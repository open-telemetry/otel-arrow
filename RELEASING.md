To make a release of one or more Golang modules in the OTel Arrow
repository, follow these steps.

1. Using Git, checkout the version of the repo that will be released
   and create a new branch for the release, for example,

```
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b release_xx_yy_zz
```

2. Make sure the CHANGELOG.md file is up to date, add entries
   describing the changes in the new release.  If collector
   dependencies have changed during this release cycle, `make
   genotelarrowcol` should have been run to synchronize dependencies.

3. Using Make, prepare the release means updating Go modules and
   checking in the changes, for example.

```
make prepare-release
```

4. Push the branch and open a PR to submit these changes to the
   upstream repository's main branch.

5. After merging the PR, pull the upstream commit, for example,

```
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
```

6. Push the release, for example,

```
make push-release
```

7. The tag has now been published, but need to manually create the release in the Github UI. Go to https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/releases and click `Draft a new release`. Select the tag you pushed in step 6 and link the Changelog in the description, following the convention of previous releases. TODO: automate this step to trigger whenever a new release tag is pushed.

The release has been published.  Note that these instructions do not
cover the use of multiple module sets, since this repository uses a
single module set named "beta" at this time.

7. Re-enable CI/CD by reverting the change to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
