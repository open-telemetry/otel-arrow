Module: test_definition

This module defines the `TestDefinition` class, which encapsulates a test scenario in a load generation
testbed. The `TestDefinition` class allows for defining a sequence of test steps, executing them, and
reporting the results through specified reporting strategies.

The class provides the functionality to aggregate monitoring data during the test execution and apply
different reporting strategies to the results.

Classes:
    TestDefinition: A class that defines a test, including the steps to run and the reporting strategies to use.

    A class that defines a test scenario, including its steps and reporting strategies.

    The `TestDefinition` class encapsulates the details of a test, including the steps to execute and
