"""
Module: lifecycle_component

This module defines the abstract base class `LifecycleComponent`, which serves as a blueprint for components
managed by the orchestrator. It provides hooks for various lifecycle phases such as configuration,
deployment, starting, stopping, and destruction, allowing for custom behavior during these phases.

Components derived from `LifecycleComponent` must implement the lifecycle methods (`configure`, `deploy`,
`start`, `stop`, and `destroy`) and can register hooks to be executed at specific points in the lifecycle.

Classes:
    LifecyclePhase: An enumeration of the different phases in the lifecycle of a component.
    LifecycleComponent: An abstract base class that defines the structure for components with lifecycle hooks.

    """
    Abstract base class for components within a load generation test orchestrator.

    This class provides a mechanism for registering and executing hooks at various lifecycle phases, allowing
    subclasses to define specific behaviors during phases such as configuration, deployment, starting, stopping,
    and destruction. Subclasses are required to implement the lifecycle methods (`configure`, `deploy`, `start`,
    `stop`, and `destroy`).

    Components can register hooks that will be executed during specific lifecycle phases. Hooks are callable
    functions that are executed when a particular phase occurs, enabling custom actions at various points in the
    lifecycle.

    Attributes:
        _hooks (Dict[LifecyclePhase, List[Callable]]): A registry of hooks for each lifecycle phase,
                                                       where the key is the phase and the value is a list of
                                                       callable functions to execute during that phase.

    Methods:
        add_hook(phase, hook): Registers a hook function to be executed during a specified lifecycle phase.
        _run_hooks(phase): Executes all hooks that have been registered for a specified lifecycle phase.
        configure(): Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses for configuring the component.
        deploy(): Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses for deploying the component (e.g. spawn process, start container).
        start(): Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses for starting the component's execution behavior (e.g. send load).
        stop(): Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses for stopping the component's execution behavior (e.g. stop load).
        destroy(): Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses for destroying the component (e.g. kill process, stop/remove container).
        start_monitoring(): Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses to start monitoring the component.
        stop_monitoring(): Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses to stop monitoring the component.
        collect_monitoring_data(): Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses to collect monitoring data for the component.
