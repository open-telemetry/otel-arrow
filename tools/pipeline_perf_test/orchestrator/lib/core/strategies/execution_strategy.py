"""
Module: execution_strategy

This module defines the `ExecutionStrategy` abstract base class, which provides a unified
interface for controlling the execution behavior of testbed components in a load generation
environment.

Execution strategies encapsulate how a component runs or behaves at runtime. This separation
of concerns allows different execution modes to be applied to the same deployment and configuration
mechanisms.

Typical implementations of this interface include:
    - GenerateLoad: Starts a component that actively generates load (e.g., otlp, arrow, etc).
    - ReceiveLoad: Starts a component that passively receives load (e.g., validating otlp receiver).

Classes:
    ExecutionStrategyConfig(BaseModel):  Base model for Execution Strategy config.
    ExecutionStrategy (ABC): Abstract interface for starting and stopping a component's workload execution.
