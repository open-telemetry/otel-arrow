Module: monitoring_strategy

This module defines the `MonitoringStrategy` abstract base class, which provides
a common interface for monitoring components in a load generation testbed.

Monitoring strategies are responsible for gathering, starting, and stopping monitoring
for components during tests. This can involve collecting performance metrics, logging,
or gathering any relevant statistics or insights from the component.

Classes:
    MonitoringStrategyConfig(BaseModel): Base class for configuring monitoring strategies.
    MonitoringStrategy (ABC): Abstract base class for all monitoring strategies.
