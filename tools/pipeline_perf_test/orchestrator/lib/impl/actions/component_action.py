"""
Module: component_action

This module defines a step action for executing a single lifecycle method
on a single test component within the orchestrator framework. It enables steps
in a test scenario to trigger specific component behaviors (such as starting monitoring or deploying a service) based on the defined
phase.

The action is registered under the name `"component_action"` in the test step action registry,
and is configured via `ComponentActionConfig`.

Typical YAML configuration example:

```yaml
tests:
  - name: Test Max Rate Logs
    steps:
    - name: Start Load Generator
      action:
        component_action:
          phase: start
          target: load-generator
```

Key Classes:

ComponentActionConfig: Defines the configuration schema for the action, including the
target component name and the phase to invoke.

ComponentAction: Retrieves the specified component from the step context and invokes
the method corresponding to the given phase.
