"""
Module defining a step action that introduces a delay during test execution.

This module provides a simple mechanism to pause a test step for a specified number of seconds,
which can be useful for timing control, waiting for external processes, or creating intentional
delays between test phases.

Typical YAML configuration example:

```yaml
tests:
  - name: Test Max Rate Logs
    steps:
    - name: Wait For Test
      action:
        wait:
          delay_seconds: 3
```

Classes:
    - WaitActionConfig: Configuration class that specifies the delay duration in seconds.
    - WaitAction: Step action that performs a blocking wait based on the configured delay.

The action is registered in the test step action registry under the name `"wait"`.

Usage:
    Include this action in a test step to introduce a time-based pause.

Example:
    delay_seconds: 2.5  # Waits for 2.5 seconds when the step is executed
