    Hook strategy to remove an existing Docker container with the same name as the current component.

    This hook is useful during the pre-deployment phase of a component lifecycle to ensure that
    any previously running container (possibly left over from an earlier run) is cleaned up before
    starting a new one. This avoids container name conflicts and ensures consistent environment setup.

    Behavior:
        - If a container is found with the same name as the component, it is stopped and removed.
        - If no container is found (404), the hook is skipped silently.
        - If no component is available in the context, the hook fails.

    Hook status:
        - FAILURE if no component is found in context.
        - SKIPPED if the container is not found or no action is needed.

    Raises:
        docker.errors.APIError: Only if an unexpected Docker API issue occurs (currently suppressed for 404s).

    Typical usage:
        - Pre-deployment cleanup to avoid naming conflicts.
        - Resetting environment between pipeline/test runs where container reuse is not desired.
