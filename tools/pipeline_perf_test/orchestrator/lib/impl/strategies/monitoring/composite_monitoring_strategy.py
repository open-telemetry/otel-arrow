"""
This module defines the CompositeMonitoringStrategy class, which allows combining
multiple monitoring strategies into a unified interface.

The CompositeMonitoringStrategy class enables flexible and modular monitoring by
delegating lifecycle methods (`start`, `stop`, and `collect`) to a collection of
individual monitoring strategies. This pattern is especially useful when a component
needs to be monitored through multiple data sources (e.g., process-level stats,
Docker metrics, custom probes) simultaneously.

Usage:
    - Instantiate with a list of concrete MonitoringStrategy implementations.
    - Call `start`, `stop`, and `collect` as you would with a single strategy.
