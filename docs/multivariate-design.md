# OTel-Arrow Multivariate Metrics Design

## Overview

Multivariate metrics in OpenTelemetry represent multiple measurements that are
logically related and captured at the same moment in time. These measurements
provide different dimensions of the same system property and must be temporally
aligned to provide an accurate system state representation.

## OpenTelemetry Requirement

The OpenTelemetry API model defines a critical requirement for multivariate
metrics:

```md
The API MUST treat observations from a single Callback as logically
taking place at a single instant, such that when recorded,
observations from a single callback MUST be reported with identical
timestamps.
```

This requirement ensures temporal consistency between related measurements and
forms the foundation of OTel-Arrow's multivariate design.

## OTel-Arrow Protocol Design

OTel-Arrow implements multivariate metrics by definition. When multiple metric
data points have identical resource, instrumentation scope, and timestamp, they
are by definition multivariate.

## Phased exploration

### Phase 1

During Phase 1, we explored potential cost savings from the use of multivariate
metrics, because there is a natural compression benefit from grouping related
data. The implementation used explicit configuration, instead of a natural
multivarate metric API.

For example, a configuration stating that `memory.usage` and `memory.limit` (in
some scope) should be multivariate, then any observations of those sharing
resource and timestamp would become multivariate in the representation.
However, we removed this feature from the reference implementation prior to
stabilizing the Phase 1 protocol.

### Phase 2

In phase 2, as we implement an end-to-end OTAP pipeline, we will examine the use
of multivariate metrics APIs.

We will explore synthesizing well-defined multivariate metrics APIs using
OTel-Weaver. As an example relevant for self-observability in a pipeline
scenario, consider the recording of `success`, `failed`, `dropped`,
`compressed_bytes`, and `uncompressed_bytes` counts associated with a single
request in the pipeline.  This is a natural case for multivariate metrics, and
we will explore recording these attributes in the correct types in the
"OTAP-direct" SDK.
