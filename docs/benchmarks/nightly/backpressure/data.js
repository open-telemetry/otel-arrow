Ordinarily we wouldn't encode attributes like this in\nOTAP because it we'd use the AttributeValuesType::Empty value in the\ntype column, but we handle it because it is valid arrow data since the\ncolumns are nullable.\n\n**Context:** \nwhen fixing #966 we added code to eagerly remove the transport optimized\nencoding from when transforming attributes, and noticed a significant\nregression in the performance benchmarks, especially on OTAP-ATTR-OTAP\nscenario because we do a round trip decode/encode of the transport\noptimized encoding.\n\n**Changes**\n\nThis PR specifically focuses on optimizing adding the transport\noptimized encoding for attributes, as this is where all the time was\nbeing spent. Adding this encoding involves sorting the attribute record\nbatch by type, key, value, then parent_id, and adding delta encoding to\nthe parent_id column for sequences where type, key and value are all\nequal to the previous row (unless value is null, or the type is Map or\nSlice).\n\nBefore this change, we were doing this sorting using arrow's\n`RowConverter`. We'd then do a second pass over the dataset to find\nsequences where type/key/value were equal, and apply the delta encoding\nto the parent_id column.\n\nAlthough using the `RowConverter` is sometimes [an efficient way to sort\nmultiple\ncolumns](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/11/07/multi-column-sorts-in-arrow-rust-part-2/),\nit's notable that the `RowConverter` actually expands the dictionaries\nfor all the columns before it sorts (see\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/4811). This is extremely\nexpensive for us since most of our attribute columns are dictionary\nencoded.\n\nThis PR changes the implementation to sort the attributes record batch\ndirectly, starting by combining type & key together (using the sorted\ndictionary values from the keys column), then sorting this hybrid\ncolumn. It then partitions the type column to identify the attributes\nvalue column for this segment of the sorted result, and partitions the\nkey column to find segments of the value column to sort together. For\neach segment, it sorts it, appends it to a builder for the new values\ncolumn. It then partitions the sorted segment of values and for each\nsegment takes the parent_ids for the value segment, sorts them, adds\ndelta encoding, and appends these to a buffer containing the encoded\nparent IDs. Then it combines everything together and produces the\nresult.\n\nThe advantages of this approach are a) it's a lot faster and b) we build\nup enough state during the sorting that we don't need to do a second\npass over the `RecordBatch` to add delta encoding.\n\nThere are quite a few transformations that happen, and I tried to do\nthese as efficiently as possible. This means working with arrow's\nbuffers directly in many places, instead of always using immutable\n`Array`s and compute kernels, which reduces quite a lot the amount of\nallocations.\n\n**Future Work/Followups**\nThere are some code paths I didn't spent a lot of time optimizing:\n- If the parent_id is a u32 which may be dictionary encoded, we simply\ncast it to a primitive array and then cast it back into a dict when\nwe're done. I did some quick testing and figure this adds ~10% overhead.\n- If the value type is something that could be in a dictionary (string,\nint, bytes, & ser columns), but isn't dictionary encoded, or if the type\nis boolean, the way we build up the result column allocates many small\narrays. This could be improved\n- If the key column is not dictionary encoded. I didn't spend very much\ntime optimizing this.\n\nThere's also probably some methods that we were using before to encode\nthe ID column that I need to go back and delete\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\nRelated to #1853 \n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nExisting unit tests plus new ones\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Joshua MacDonald <jmacd@users.noreply.github.com>\nCo-authored-by: Utkarsh Umesan Pillai <66651184+utpilla@users.noreply.github.com>",

Updates OTel feature settings to\ndisable the OTel logging SDK from the build.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\nRemoves `ProviderMode::OpenTelemetry`, the OTel logging SDK and its\nassociated configuration (service::telemetry::logs::processors::*).\n\nFixes #1576.\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nYes.\n\n**Note: this removes the potential to use the OpenTelemetry tracing\nsupport via the opentelemetry tracing appender. However, we view tracing\ninstrumentation as having limited value until otap-dataflow is properly\ninstrumented for tracing. When this happens, we are likely to use an\ninternal tracing pipeline.**\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Utkarsh Umesan Pillai <66651184+utpilla@users.noreply.github.com>",

(#1963)\n\n# Change Summary\n\nWhen processing OTLP metrics, calling `OtlpProtoBytes::num_items()`\npanics with the message `ToDo`. This happens because metrics_data_view\nwas previously unimplemented, but has since been added without the\ncorresponding counter logic for num_items(). This PR implements this\nlogic.\n\nImportant to mention that the implementation counts data points since\n`otap.rs` does the same thing in its definition of `num_items`.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/8c726ba2cb1ff2463db6c67ed0f03b102d322a54/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/pdata/src/otap.rs#L423-L430\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/issues/1923\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nTODO\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: albertlockett <a.lockett@f5.com>",

This now reindexes all the required columns, has support for\nmetrics, and has support for dictionary encoded columns.\n\nI also was able to uncomment most of the batching tests after this\nchange 🥳. One more to go which requires split.\n\nOther minor changes:\n\n- Made it so that `allowed_payload_types` returns payload types in the\nexact same order that they are stored. This is occasionally handy to\nhave.\n\nThings deferred:\n\n- Benchmarks. I had nothing to compare it to since the original didn't\nreindex a bunch of the necessary columns anyway like scope or resource\nid nor did it support dictionaries. I'll add these in when I get to the\nnext point..\n- Some optimization opportunities like using naive offsets instead of\nsorting and reindexing everything starting at 0. We need this path\nbecause it's possible to get into situations where we absolutely need to\ncompact things down to fit into u16, but we can likely skip it a decent\nportion of the time.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\nPart of #1926.\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nI added a big unit test suite.\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: albertlockett <a.lockett@f5.com>",

I believe\n`one_of` better reflect the underlying implementation (was never really\na round robin strategy as the channel receivers were competing\ntogether).\n- broadcast is currently parsed but rejected for multi-destination edges\n(reserved for future support)\n    - single-destination edges treat dispatch as no-op\n- Refactored PipelineConfigBuilder API for readability in tests:\n- one_of(src, targets) and broadcast(src, targets) for default output\n- one_of_output(src, output, targets) and broadcast_output(...) for\nexplicit output\n    - added to(src, dst) and to_output(src, output, dst) aliases\n- Updated engine wiring internals and channel identity labeling to use\ndispatch policy terminology (one_of/broadcast) consistently.\n- Updated docs and examples to the new model:\n\n**To do: update the configuration of our continuous benchmarks.**\n  \n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* Closes #1970 \n* Closes #1828\n* Closes #1829 \n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nAll unit tests passed\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nThe structure of the configuration files have changed.",

I believe\n`one_of` better reflect the underlying implementation (was never really\na round robin strategy as the channel receivers were competing\ntogether).\n- broadcast is currently parsed but rejected for multi-destination edges\n(reserved for future support)\n    - single-destination edges treat dispatch as no-op\n- Refactored PipelineConfigBuilder API for readability in tests:\n- one_of(src, targets) and broadcast(src, targets) for default output\n- one_of_output(src, output, targets) and broadcast_output(...) for\nexplicit output\n    - added to(src, dst) and to_output(src, output, dst) aliases\n- Updated engine wiring internals and channel identity labeling to use\ndispatch policy terminology (one_of/broadcast) consistently.\n- Updated docs and examples to the new model:\n\n**To do: update the configuration of our continuous benchmarks.**\n  \n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* Closes #1970 \n* Closes #1828\n* Closes #1829 \n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nAll unit tests passed\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nThe structure of the configuration files have changed.",

This maps to the existing\n`AuthMethod::UserManagedIdentityByResourceId` in `geneva-uploader` - no\nnew auth logic added.\n\n### Changes:\n- New `AuthConfig` variant with `resource_id` and `msi_resource` fields\n- Mapping to `AuthMethod::UserManagedIdentityByResourceId` in\n`from_config`\n   - `msi_resource` extraction for the new variant\n- Extended `test_auth_config_variants` to cover all five auth variants\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Utkarsh Umesan Pillai <66651184+utpilla@users.noreply.github.com>\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>",

For example, it\ncould evaluate expressions such as `severity_number + attributes[\"x\"] *\n2`.\n\nNote that the expression evaluation isn't yet integrated into any\n`PipelineStage` implementation, but the intention is that this can soon\nbe used to implement more advanced filtering, attribute insertion,\ncolumn updates and so on.\n\nWhile on the surface, this isolated simple arithmetic not appear\nterribly useful, the main/important contributions in this PR are to lay\ndown some foundations for future expression evaluation:\n\n**Transparent joins in the expression tree**\nThis PR adds is the ability to evaluate a set of DataFusion expressions\nwhile transparently joining data from different record batches as the\nexpression evaluates.\n\nFor example, consider we had `severity_number * 2 + attributes[\"x\"] +\nattributes[\"y\"]`, we'd need to first evaluate:\n- 1. `severity_number * 2`\n- 2. `attributes where key = \"x\"`, then select the value column based on\nthe type\n- 3. `attributes where key = \"y\"`, then select the value column based on\nthe type,\n\nThen we need to join these three expressions on the ID/parent ID\nrelationship, then perform the additions.\n\nThis PR builds the expression tree in such a way that it can manage\nwhere these joins need to happen on either side of a binary expression,\nand it performs the joins automatically during expression evaluation\nwhile keeping track of the ID scope/row order of the current data at\neach stage.\n\n**Type evaluation and coercion**\n\nWhile planning the expression, the planner attempts to keep track of\nwhat are the possible types that the expression could produce if it were\nto successfully evaluate. When it detects invalid types, it is able to\nproduce an error indicating an invalid expression.\n\nFor example, we'd be able to detect at planning time that `severity_text\n+ 2` is invalid, because text can't be added to a number.\n\nFor expressions where we can't determine that the types are invalid at\nplanning time, it will be determined and runtime and an error will be\nproduced when the expression evaluates on some batch. For example\n`attributes[\"x\"] + 2`, it's unknown whether `attributes[\"x\"]` is an\nint64, so it's assumed that the expression will produce an int64, and if\n`attributes[\"x\"]` is found not to be this type, an ExecutionError will\nbe produced.\n\nThe planner automatically coerces integer types when necessary.\nCurrently when adding two integers, they will be coerced into the\nlargest type that could contain the value, while keeping the signed-ness\nof one side. For example, uint8 + int32 will produce an int32. I realize\nthis type of automatic integer coercion is probably controversial, so in\nthe future I'm happy to get rid of this in favour of forcing explicit\ncasting if that is preferred.\n\n**Missing data / null propagation**\n\nWhen one side of an expression is null, for the purposes of arithmetic\nthe expression will evaluate to null. This includes the case of null\nvalues, missing attributes, missing columns, and missing optional record\nbatches.\n\nFor example: `attributes[\"x\"] + 2` would evaluate as null if the\nattribtues record batch was not present, there were no attributes with\n`key == \"x\"`, or the attributes where `key==\"x\"` had type empty, and so\non.\n\n**Relocated the projection code**\n\nAdds a new module called `pipeline::project` which has the projection\ncode that was previously inside the filter module. We need to project\nthe input record batches into a known schema to evaluate the\nexpressions, and also consider the expression evaluation to result in a\n`null` if the projection could evaluate due to missing data.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n<!--\nWe highly recommend correlation of every PR to an issue\n-->\n\n* Relates to https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/issues/2058\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nThere are 64 new unit tests covering these changes\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\n <!-- If yes, provide further info below -->\n\nNo\n\n\n## Future work/followups:\nThere are many, but most pressing are:\n- Other types of expression evaluation, including string expressions,\nunary math expressions, function invocation and bridging this with the\nfiltering code (for expressions that produce boolean arrays).\n- Integrating expression evaluation with various pipeline stages\nincluding those which set attributes, set values, and filtering\n- OPL Parser support for the type of expressions we're able to evaluate\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Laurent Quérel <laurent.querel@gmail.com>\nCo-authored-by: Laurent Quérel <l.querel@f5.com>",

          "message": "feat: handle Ack and Nack messages in OTAP Exporter. (#1994)\n\n# Change Summary\n\nPart of #1325 (see also #1324).\n\n## Problem: flaky test due to sleep-based synchronization.\n\nThe OTAP Exporter had two related issues:\n\n### 1. Dropped Context\n\nWhen the exporter received pipeline data (OtapPdata), it split the\nmessage into context and payload, then threw away the context:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/82f71508f8e598e78853335cce82195e894894cd/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/otap/src/otap_exporter.rs#L233-L235\n\nThe context carries routing information that tells the pipeline who to\nnotify when a message succeeds or fails. Without it, the exporter was a\nblack hole — data went in, but no confirmation ever came back.\n\n### 2. Flaky Test\n\nThe test `test_receiver_not_ready_on_start` had no way to know when the\nexporter finished processing, so it used arbitrary sleeps:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/82f71508f8e598e78853335cce82195e894894cd/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/otap/src/otap_exporter.rs#L866-L868\n\n\nhttps://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/82f71508f8e598e78853335cce82195e894894cd/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/otap/src/otap_exporter.rs#L870-L872\n\n\nhttps://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/82f71508f8e598e78853335cce82195e894894cd/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/otap/src/otap_exporter.rs#L883-L885\n\nOn a slow machine or under load, these might not be long enough. On a\nfast machine, they waste time.\n\n## Solution: thread context through for ACK/NACK.\n\nThe core idea is to preserve the `OtapPdata` context by using\n`take_payload()` instead of `into_parts()`.\n\nThis extracts the payload for gRPC transmission while keeping the\ncontext alive in the original OtapPdata. Then pass that context through\nthe entire streaming pipeline so it can be returned with ACK (success)\nor NACK (failure) notifications.\n\n## Key changes\n\n1. Preserve context at the entry point\n\n```rust\n  // Before: context discarded\n  let (_context, payload) = pdata.into_parts();\n\n  // After: payload extracted, context preserved\n  let payload = pdata.take_payload();\n```\n\n2. Pair each batch with its context through the pipeline\n\nThe internal channels changed from carrying just data to carrying\n(context, data) tuples:\n\n```rust\n  // Before\n  channel::<OtapArrowRecords>(64)\n\n  // After\n  channel::<(OtapPdata, OtapArrowRecords)>(64)\n```\n\n3. Correlate gRPC responses with their original requests\n\nThe exporter uses bidirectional gRPC streaming — requests go out on one\nstream, responses come back on another. A FIFO correlation channel pairs\nthem:\n\n```\n  create_req_stream ──sends pdata──→ [correlation channel] ──recv pdata──→ handle_res_stream\n    (yielded batch)                                                         (got response)\n```\n\nSince both streams are ordered, the first response always corresponds to\nthe first request.\n\n\n4. Send ACK/NACK in the main loop\n\n```rust\n  Some(PDataMetricsUpdate::Exported(signal_type, pdata)) => {\n      self.pdata_metrics.inc_exported(signal_type);\n      effect_handler.notify_ack(AckMsg::new(pdata)).await?;\n  },\n  Some(PDataMetricsUpdate::Failed(signal_type, pdata)) => {\n      self.pdata_metrics.inc_failed(signal_type);\n      effect_handler.notify_nack(NackMsg::new(\"export failed\", pdata)).await?;\n  },\n```\n\nThe effect_handler uses the context inside pdata to route ACK/NACK back\nthrough the pipeline.\n\n\n5. Replace sleeps with deterministic waits in the test\n\n```Rust\n  // Before: sleep and hope\n  tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(5)).await;\n\n  // After: wait for the actual event\n  timeout(Duration::from_secs(5), async {\n      loop {\n          match pipeline_ctrl_msg_rx.recv().await {\n              Ok(PipelineControlMsg::DeliverNack { .. }) => break,\n              Ok(_) => continue,\n              Err(_) => panic!(\"pipeline ctrl channel closed\"),\n          }\n      }\n  }).await.expect(\"Timed out waiting for NACK\");\n```\n\nThe test is now event-driven: it proceeds as soon as the NACK/ACK\narrives, with a 5-second timeout as a safety net.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/issues/1611\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\n <!-- If yes, provide further info below -->\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Drew Relmas <drewrelmas@gmail.com>",

This enables direct traversal of\nmetrics Arrow RecordBatches without intermediate conversion to protobuf\nor Prost types.\n\n## New file: views/otap/metrics.rs \n\nComplete metrics hierarchy:\n- OtapMetricsView → ResourceMetrics → ScopeMetrics → MetricView →\nDataView\n- Gauge/Sum/Histogram/ExpHistogram/Summary views\n- NumberDataPoint, HistogramDataPoint, ExpHistogramDataPoint,\nSummaryDataPoint views\n- ExemplarView, BucketsView, ValueAtQuantileView\n\n## Modified files (visibility only)\n- MetricsArrays/QuantileArrays/PositiveNegativeArrayAccess fields →\npub(crate)\n- Shared helpers in logs.rs → pub(crate) for reuse\n- views/otap.rs: added mod metrics + re-export\n\n## Design\n- Pre-computed BTreeMap indexes at construction (same as OtapLogsView)\n- Reuses RowGroup, OtapAttributeView, OtapAnyValueView from logs module\n- Introduces Otap32AttributeIter for u32-keyed dp/exemplar attributes\n\nCo-authored-by: Gyan Ranjan Panda <gyanranjanpanda@users.noreply.github.com>\nCo-authored-by: albertlockett <a.lockett@f5.com>",

Before this\nchange, we were simply using arrow's `concat_batches` helper function\nwith expects all the `RecordBatch`s to have the same schema. However,\nthis would cause a problem if some branch of the statement changes the\nschema.\n\nThis PR corrects the issue by using OTAP's\n[`concatenate`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/eaa4103326057ef68125244171801bc010cb3571/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/pdata/src/otap/transform/concatenate.rs#L75)\nfunction instead which correctly expands each `RecordBatch` into a\ncommon schema.\n\nThere's one pipeline stage that also writes new IDs to the rows with\nnull IDs (this happens when we assign attributes). In order for\n`concatenate` to produce a valid batch, we need to ensure the IDs are\nglobally unique. This PR adds a mechanism to initialize shared state for\ndifferent implementations of the same pipeline stage if they're being\nused in a nested branch within conditional pipeline stage, and uses it\nfor the purpose of ensuring unique IDs when filling in these null rows.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n<!--\nWe highly recommend correlation of every PR to an issue\n-->\n\n* Closes #2216 \n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nUnit tests\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo\n\n <!-- If yes, provide further info below -->",

After\nthe fix, duration metrics, as set by the top-level policy.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>",

          "message": "Add data sanitization step for transform processor results (#2434)\n\n# Change Summary\n\n<!--\nReplace with a brief summary of the change in this PR\n-->\n\nAdds a \"sanitization\" step which can be performed on the result produced\nby the transform processor. This passes over all the the columns in all\nthe RecordBatch's and removes any values from dictionary columns that\nhave no keys pointing to them.\n\nThe procedure has some performance overhead, so there is an option to\nskip if if, for example the transformation isn't removing sensitive\ndata, or if something further along in the pipeline would remove the\nhidden arrow data (for example, serializing to OTLP in the OTLP\nexporter).\n\n**Why is this necessary?**\nSome of the arrow compute kernels will perform transformations ignoring\ncertain buffers for best performance if the result would still be a\nsemantically correct arrow array. For example when filtering, the arrow\ncompute kernels only filter dictionary key columns without touching the\ndictionaries.\n\nI'm imagining that someday someone will try to use transform processor\nto try to redact sensitive data, but the values from the rows they\ndeleted will still be present in the arrow buffers. If they then\ntransmitted the data using OTAP exporter (which does a simple arrow IPC\nserialization), the \"redacted\" data has escaped.\n\n**Why blindly do this for all transforms on all columns? Can't the\nquery-engine be smarter about this?**\nMaybe - but it's not as simple as it appears.\n\nFor example, consider when we're filtering. If we did something like:\n`logs | where event_name != \"sensitive_event_name\"`, it might be easy to\nthink that `event_name` is the sensitive column so it's the only one\nthat needs sanitizing. But _maybe_ the user actually knows a-priori that\nany log w/ this event name actually has sensitive data in some other\ncolumn.\n\nWhen it comes to the security of, I feel that it's better to be err on\nthe side of caution.\n\nIn the future we could maybe consider a better system where we let the\nuser provide hints about what fields they consider sensitive.\n\n**What's the performance impact?**\n\nThis sanitizing step adds significant overhead. When adding this\nsanitization step into the query engine's benchmarks, I saw anywhere\nbetween 5%-45% performance overhead on top of just executing the\ntransform pipeline w/ no sanitization. The actual overhead depends on\nthe complexity of the transform and size of output.\n\nThis poor performance is another reason why there's an option to skip\nthis step.\n\n**Should sanitize be on by default?**\n\nMy feeling is yes. If someone forgets to configure this or misconfigures\nit, I feel that it's best to fail on the side of worse\nperformance/better security.\n\n**Does this have to happen in the transform processor?**\n\nI feel that this is a reasonable place to do this, but open to\nsuggestions if anyone feels differently.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n<!--\nWe highly recommend correlation of every PR to an issue\n-->\n\n* Closes #2313\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nUnit tests\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nThere's a new user facing config field called `skip_sanitize_result`\n\n <!-- If yes, provide further info below -->\n\nCo-authored-by: Laurent Quérel <l.querel@f5.com>",

Meanwhile,\n`engine-recordset-otlp-bridge` (a `query_engine` member) had a\ndev-dependency pointing back into `otap-dataflow`:\n\n```toml\n# rust/experimental/query_engine/engine-recordset-otlp-bridge/Cargo.toml\n[dev-dependencies]\notap-df-pdata = { path = \"../../../otap-dataflow/crates/pdata\", features = [\"testing\"] }\n```\n\nThis bidirectional cross-workspace reference causes cargo's package\ndiscovery to fail when resolving any `otap-dataflow` crate as an\nexternal git dependency:\n\n```\nerror: no matching package named `otap-df-pdata` found\nlocation searched: Git repository .../otel-arrow.git?rev=...\n```\n\n## Fix\n\n**`engine-recordset-otlp-bridge/Cargo.toml`** — Removed the\n`otap-df-pdata` dev-dependency.\n\n**`engine-recordset-otlp-bridge/benches/extend.rs`** — Replaced the\nimported `logs_with_varying_attributes_and_properties` fixture with a\nself-contained `generate_logs_batch` function that builds equivalent\n`ExportLogsServiceRequest` protobuf bytes using `opentelemetry-proto`\ntypes (already a dev-dependency). The benchmark logic is otherwise\nunchanged.\n\n## Validation\n\n- `cargo check --workspace` in `query_engine` — passes\n- `cargo bench -p data_engine_recordset_otlp_bridge --no-run` —\nbenchmark compiles\n- `cargo xtask check` in `otap-dataflow` — structure checks, fmt, clippy\n(0 warnings), all tests pass\n- Tested as external git dep consumer from a downstream project — cargo\nresolves all `otap-df-*` packages successfully",

This was causing pipeline-perf-test-basic to fail\nconsistently.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\npipeline-perf-test-basic unit test is failing.\n\n* Closes #2511\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nfake_data_generator and runtime_control_metrics tests were executed.\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo, fake_data_generator is an internal test/load-generation receiver,\nnot a user-facing component.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Lalit Kumar Bhasin <lalit_fin@yahoo.com>\nCo-authored-by: Joshua MacDonald <josh.macdonald@gmail.com>\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>\nCo-authored-by: Joshua MacDonald <jmacd@users.noreply.github.com>",

I was thinking\nthis'd be helpful for folks coming from a datafusion/SQL background. So\nit's equally possibly to write an expression like:\n```js\nlogs | set event_name = concat_ws(\" \", \"event happened:\", event_name)\n```\n\nIn `planner.rs`, I refactored the planning of function arguments into a\nreusable helper function.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n<!--\nWe highly recommend correlation of every PR to an issue\n-->\n\n* Related to #2578\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nUnit\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\n <!-- If yes, provide further info below -->\n \nThese new expression types are now supported via the transform\nprocessor.\n\n## Future work\n\nWill add support for the `TextExpression::Capture` variant of this\nexpression in future PR.",

          "message": "feat(config): add optional field to EngineConfig (#2727)\n\nAllow applications embedding the dataflow engine to carry their own\nengine-level configuration under `engine.custom`. The engine ignores\nthis field entirely; embedding binaries can read namespaced keys for\nconcerns like remote management, auth, or fleet coordination.\n\n# Change Summary\n\nAdd an optional `custom: HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>` field to\n`EngineConfig`. This gives embedding applications an escape hatch for\nengine-level config without forking the config crate or pre-parsing\nYAML. The field defaults to an empty map and is omitted from serialized\noutput when empty.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* Closes #2561\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nThree new unit tests in `engine.rs`:\n- `from_yaml_accepts_custom_config` — parses a config with multiple\nnamespaced custom keys and verifies values\n- `custom_defaults_to_empty` — confirms the field defaults to an empty\nmap when omitted\n- `custom_roundtrips_through_json` — serializes to JSON and deserializes\nback, verifying data is preserved\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nYes. A new optional `custom` key is available under the `engine` section\nof the YAML/JSON config. Example:\n\n```yaml\nengine:\n  custom:\n    remote_management:\n      server_url: \"ws://mgmt.example.com/v1\"\n      heartbeat_interval_secs: 10\n    custom_auth:\n      provider: \"oidc\"\n      token_endpoint: \"https://auth.example.com/token\"\n```\n\nExisting configs are unaffected since the field defaults to empty.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Lalit Kumar Bhasin <lalit_fin@yahoo.com>",

Previously, if a CA certificate file was replaced within\nthe same second (e.g., by automation or cert-manager), the file watcher\ncould miss the change entirely, leaving stale CA certificates in memory\nuntil the next reload event.

          "message": "Add live pipeline reconfiguration and shutdown control to the admin API (#2618)\n\n## Change Summary\n\nThis PR adds live pipeline lifecycle control to the OTAP Dataflow Engine\nadmin API.\n\nThe controller now runs as a resident runtime manager and supports\nin-memory pipeline operations on a running engine:\n\n- create a new pipeline in an existing group\n- replace an existing pipeline with a health-gated serial rolling\ncutover\n- resize a pipeline when only the effective core allocation changes\n- detect identical updates and return a successful `noop` result\n- shut down an individual logical pipeline and track shutdown progress\n\nThe PR also adds rollout and shutdown status resources, extends runtime\nand observed-state tracking with deployment generations so overlapping\ninstances remain distinguishable, updates the Rust admin SDK with typed\nlive-control methods/outcomes, and documents the feature.\n\n## Design Decisions\n\nThis PR keeps live reconfiguration scoped to one logical pipeline at a\ntime, keyed by `(group, pipeline)`. Reconfiguration mutations go through\none declarative endpoint, `PUT /api/v1/groups/{group}/pipelines/{id}`,\nwhile pipeline shutdown remains a separate operation through `POST\n/api/v1/groups/{group}/pipelines/{id}/shutdown`.\n\nThe controller classifies each reconfiguration request as `create`,\n`noop`, `resize`, or `replace` instead of exposing separate start,\nscale, and update APIs.\n\nTopology and node-configuration changes use a serial rolling cutover\nwith overlap: start the new instance on one core, wait for `Admitted`\nand `Ready`, then drain the old instance on that core. This preserves\ncontinuity while fitting the existing runtime model, without requiring a\nfull second serving fleet or a separate traffic-switching layer.\n\nPure core-allocation changes use a dedicated internal resize path so\nscale up/down only starts or stops the delta cores and leaves unchanged\ncores running.\n\nRuntime mutations remain intentionally narrow. This PR keeps changes in\nmemory only and rejects updates that would require topic-broker\nreconfiguration or broader engine/group-level policy mutation. Runtime\nconfig persistence remains out of scope.\n\nOperations are explicit and observable through rollout and shutdown ids.\nTerminal operation history is intentionally bounded in memory, so old\nrollout/shutdown ids may eventually return `404` or `Ok(None)` from the\nSDK after retention pruning.\n\nObserved status is deployment-generation-aware. During overlapping\nrollouts, `/status.instances` preserves old and new runtime instances,\nwhile aggregate readiness/liveness still uses the selected serving\ngeneration per core. After controller work completes, superseded\nobserved instances are compacted so status memory does not grow\nunbounded across rollouts.\n\nThe controller also hardens lifecycle cleanup around live operations:\nworker panics are converted into terminal rollout/shutdown failure\nstates, runtime exits are reported through supervised bookkeeping, and\nshutdown drain completion waits for upstream closure rather than queue\nemptiness alone.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* Closes #2617\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nCommands run:\n\n- `cargo xtask check`\n\nAutomated coverage includes:\n\n- rollout planning for create, replace, resize, scale up/down, noop,\ntopic-mutation rejection, and conflict handling\n- rollout execution success/failure paths, rollback behavior, worker\npanic cleanup, and bounded operation retention\n- per-pipeline shutdown planning, progress tracking, conflict handling,\ntimeout behavior, and worker panic cleanup\n- observed-state generation selection, overlap-aware\n`/status.instances`, compaction of superseded generations, and\nshutdown-terminal status behavior\n- admin HTTP handlers for reconfigure, rollout status, shutdown,\nshutdown status, operation errors, wait timeouts, and missing retained\noperation ids\n- Rust admin SDK decoding for typed reconfigure/shutdown outcomes,\noperation rejection errors, pipeline details/status, and\nrollout/shutdown polling\n- engine shutdown-drain behavior where downstream nodes wait for\nupstream channel closure before completing shutdown drain\n- route/doc compatibility checks through the full workspace validation\nsuite\n\nManual validation covered:\n\n- creating a new pipeline through the admin API\n- replacing a pipeline with a topology/config change\n- resizing a pipeline by changing only core allocation\n- submitting an identical config and observing a noop rollout\n- shutting down a pipeline and observing shutdown tracking/status\n- checking generation-aware status during overlapping rollout behavior\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nYes.\n\n- The admin API now supports live pipeline create/update/resize/noop via\n`PUT /api/v1/groups/{group}/pipelines/{id}`.\n- Pipeline shutdown is available via `POST\n/api/v1/groups/{group}/pipelines/{id}/shutdown`.\n- Rollout and shutdown progress can be queried through dedicated status\nendpoints.\n- New pipeline-scoped admin routes are under `/api/v1/groups/...`.\n- Pipeline status payloads now include deployment-generation-aware\ninstance data and rollout metadata while preserving the existing\naggregate status shape.\n- Terminal rollout and shutdown ids are retained only within a bounded\nin-memory window.\n- The Rust admin SDK now exposes typed clients, request options,\noperation outcomes, and error models for live reconfiguration and\nshutdown.\n- Operator documentation was added in\n`rust/otap-dataflow/docs/admin/live-reconfiguration.md`.\n- Support for the existing WebSocket log stream endpoint\n`/api/v1/telemetry/logs/stream` is preserved/restored in this branch.",
