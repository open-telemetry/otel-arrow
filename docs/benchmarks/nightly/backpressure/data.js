The Console Exporter now exposes bounded internal telemetry for\nterminal export outcomes and actionable failure reasons:\n\n- `exporter.pdata.exports.messages{signal,outcome}`\n- `exporter.console.failures.messages{format,signal,error.type}`\n\nConsole output and ACK behavior are unchanged.\n\n### Changelog\n\n* [x] Added a `.chloggen/*.yaml` entry\n* [ ] This PR is a `chore` (indicated in title)\n* [ ] This is a documentation-only PR.",

Two pipelines can silently land on the same cores and\ncompete, and nothing in the engine knows which NUMA node a core belongs\nto.\n\nThis change resolves placement explicitly, before any pipeline launches:\n\n- The engine discovers the process-visible CPU set and the CPU-to-NUMA\nmapping.\n- The controller plans `core_count` placement globally, accounting for\nother pipelines' reserved cores.\n- `core_count` pipelines receive exclusive cores instead of silently\noverlapping.\n- Explicit `core_set` is still honored, but now fails if a requested\ncore is hidden by process affinity or cgroup limits.\n- Startup, live rollout, rollback, and full-config reconcile all share\none placement model.\n\nThe default policy is deterministic NUMA packing: it keeps a pipeline on\na single NUMA node when possible, using stable lowest-node then\nlowest-core ordering. When topology is incomplete, it falls back to\ndeterministic visible-core ordering. The policy sits behind a small\nstrategy interface, so balancing or hardware-aware strategies can be\nadded later without touching placement call sites.\n\nThis PR also adds listener-group metadata as groundwork for future\nsocket-placement work. It does **not** bind sockets, enable\n`SO_REUSEPORT`, or attach eBPF selectors - there is no production\nruntime consumer yet.\n\nThe per-record data path is unchanged. Topology discovery and placement\nplanning run only at startup and during live control operations.\n\n## Breaking Behavior Changes\n\nThese configs now fail loudly instead of doing something surprising:\n\n- `core_count` no longer clamps to the available core count. Requesting\nmore cores than are visible is now a validation error.\n- Multiple `core_count` pipelines no longer overlap on the same first\ncores. Each gets an exclusive set, and startup or live update fails when\nthere aren't enough unreserved cores.\n- `core_count: 0` means \"all unreserved visible cores\" and can now fail\nif none remain.\n- Explicit `core_set` fails if any requested core is hidden by process\naffinity or cgroup CPU limits.\n- Full-config reconcile rejects placement transitions that need another\nlive pipeline to vacate cores first. Stage the shrink or delete first,\nthen apply the growth.\n\nExplicit `core_set`-to-`core_set` overlap is still allowed, as\ndeliberate operator intent.\n\n  * Closes #1837\n\nRelated context, not closed by this PR: #2155 (placement abstraction /\nbalancing), #2974 (socket + eBPF placement).\n\n  ## How are these changes tested?\n\n  New and updated unit coverage:\n\n- Linux topology discovery from sysfs, affinity, and cgroup v2 cpuset\nlimits\n- complete, partial, and unknown topology states, including disjoint\naffinity/cgroup visibility\n  - cpulist parse errors, oversized ranges, and duplicate CPU mappings\n  - NUMA-packing placement and deterministic fallback ordering\n  - strategy injection via the placement interface\n  - startup reservation conflicts across pipelines\n  - `core_count: 0` and omitted-count behavior\n  - explicit `core_set` hidden-core rejection\n  - live rollout, rollback, and reconcile placement handling\n  - conservative vacate-before-claim reconcile rejection\n\n  ## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\n  Yes — see **Breaking Behavior Changes** above.\n\n  ### Changelog\n\n  * [x] Added a `.chloggen/*.yaml` entry\n  * [ ] This PR is a `chore` (indicated in title)\n  * [ ] This is a documentation-only PR.",

A pull request\nmerged during that window could therefore be included in the release\ntags without appearing in that release's changelog.\n\nThis change closes the gap at three points:\n\n1. **Before and after opening the release PR:** Prepare Release records\nits starting `main` commit and verifies that the merge queue is empty\nand `main` has not moved. If the first check fails, no PR is opened. If\nthe second check fails, the release PR remains open to freeze merges and\nPrepare Release must be rerun to update it from the latest `main`.\n2. **While the release PR is open:** The required `changelog` check\nrejects every other pull request and merge-group entry. The release PR\nis allowed only when no other PR remains queued and its branch contains\nthe latest `main`.\n3. **When creating the release:** Push Release resolves the uniquely\nmerged `otelbot/release-v<VERSION>` PR and creates all release tags at\nthat PR's merge commit rather than the current `main` tip.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant MQ as Merge queue\n    participant Prep as Prepare Release\n    participant Main as main\n    participant RP as Release PR\n    participant Push as Push Release\n\n    Prep->>Main: Record starting commit\n    Prep->>MQ: Require empty queue\n    Prep->>Main: Require unchanged commit\n    Prep->>RP: Open otelbot/release-vX.Y.Z\n    Prep->>MQ: Recheck empty queue\n    Prep->>Main: Recheck unchanged commit\n\n    Note over RP,MQ: Required changelog check freezes unrelated merges\n    RP->>MQ: Require no other queued PRs\n    RP->>Main: Merge prepared changelog and versions\n\n    Push->>RP: Resolve merged release PR\n    Push->>Main: Tag the release PR merge commit\n    Note over Main,Push: Later main commits remain pending for the next release\n```\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n<!--We highly recommend correlation of every PR to an issue-->\n\nN/A\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nN/A\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo\n\n### Changelog\n\n* [x] This PR is a `chore` (indicated in title)\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot Autofix powered by AI <175728472+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>",

Those configurations can still\nrestore an existing compatible cache, but only the required Linux and\nWindows build caches are guaranteed to be refreshed after each merge.\n\nThe current cache inventory supports prioritizing these builds:\n\n| Observation | Current state |\n| --- | --- |\n| Repository cache limit | 10 GB |\n| Recent Rust cache size | Commonly 1-2 GB per entry |\n| Dominant cache refs | `refs/pull/*/merge` entries from recent PR runs\n|\n| Shared `main` Rust caches | None were present in the inspected cache\ninventory |\n\nThis means a small number of ephemeral PR entries can consume the\nrepository budget and evict caches that would otherwise be reusable by\nevery PR and merge-queue run. The restore-only Rust-CI policy stops\nadding those ephemeral entries, while the post-merge workflow\nrepopulates the two critical shared caches.",

Events without an exact override use\n  default_group.\n\n  Physical monikers are not configured in YAML. The uploader resolves the chosen\n  logical group against the current primary-moniker mapping supplied by GCS or an\n  agent-fed credential snapshot.\n\n  ## Breaking configuration change\n\n  Every Geneva exporter configuration must now provide:\n\n```yaml\n  account_routing:\n    default_group: \"<logical-account-group>\"\n```\n\n  Existing configurations must add the logical GCS account group that should\n  receive events without an explicit override.\n\n  ## Validation\n\n  - cargo xtask check\n  - cargo test -p otap-df-contrib-nodes --features geneva-exporter geneva_exporter\n      - 87 passed\n\n  - python3 tools/sanitycheck.py\n  - make chlog-validate\n  - Markdown lint\n  - git diff --check\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Utkarsh Umesan Pillai <66651184+utpilla@users.noreply.github.com>",

Events without an exact override use\n  default_group.\n\n  Physical monikers are not configured in YAML. The uploader resolves the chosen\n  logical group against the current primary-moniker mapping supplied by GCS or an\n  agent-fed credential snapshot.\n\n  ## Breaking configuration change\n\n  Every Geneva exporter configuration must now provide:\n\n```yaml\n  account_routing:\n    default_group: \"<logical-account-group>\"\n```\n\n  Existing configurations must add the logical GCS account group that should\n  receive events without an explicit override.\n\n  ## Validation\n\n  - cargo xtask check\n  - cargo test -p otap-df-contrib-nodes --features geneva-exporter geneva_exporter\n      - 87 passed\n\n  - python3 tools/sanitycheck.py\n  - make chlog-validate\n  - Markdown lint\n  - git diff --check\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Utkarsh Umesan Pillai <66651184+utpilla@users.noreply.github.com>",

          "message": "feat(engine): Add opt-in `size` metric to node produced/consumed (#3842)\n\n# Change summary\n\nClosing the loop on final piece to match the [Go Collector universal\ntelemetry RFC on auto-instrumented\nmetrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/rfcs/component-universal-telemetry.md#auto-instrumented-metrics)\n🥳\n\nAdds logical payload size to the engine-owned node outcome metrics:\n\n- `node.producer.produced.size{signal,outcome}`\n- `node.consumer.consumed.size{signal,outcome}`\n\nSize follows the existing item-count policy model. `runtime_metrics:\ndetailed` enables both measurements for every node. At `runtime_metrics:\nnormal`, nodes can independently opt in with:\n\n```yaml\npolicies:\n  telemetry:\n    size: true\n```\n\nThe forward path measures the payload once at each produced or consumed\nboundary and stores the value on the context frame. Ack/Nack unwinding\nrecords the stored size with the same signal and outcome as the\ncorresponding message metric.\n\nOTLP payloads report their encoded protobuf length. OTAP payloads report\nlogical Arrow bytes. Cached OTAP sizing avoids repeating the Arrow array\nand buffer walk when the payload is unchanged.\n\nThe `trafficgen-universal-produced-consumed-metrics.yaml` demo includes\nboth item and size policies and prints only produced/consumed node\nmetrics through its internal observability pipeline.\n\n### Sample config run\n\nThe `full` pipeline uses `runtime_metrics: detailed`. Its log sampler\nkeeps one third of log records while metrics and traces pass through\nunchanged:\n\n| Signal | Receiver produced | Sampler consumed | Sampler produced |\nNoop consumed |\n| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |\n| Logs messages | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 |\n| Logs items | 30 | 30 | 10 | 10 |\n| Logs size (By) | 7,472 | 7,472 | 6,448 | 6,448 |\n| Metrics messages | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |\n| Metrics items | 18 | 18 | 18 | 18 |\n| Metrics size (By) | 3,710 | 3,710 | 3,710 | 3,710 |\n| Traces messages | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |\n| Traces items | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 |\n| Traces size (By) | 2,290 | 2,290 | 2,290 | 2,290 |\n\nDropping two thirds of the log records reduces logical size from `7,472\nBy` to `6,448 By` rather than by two thirds. OTAP is a columnar,\nrelational representation: resource, scope, attribute, and dictionary\nbuffers remain largely unchanged, while sampling removes primarily the\nper-record offsets and dictionary keys. The synthetic records also\nrepeat values that are stored once in dictionaries. Logical Arrow size\ntherefore describes the resulting representation, not an average record\nsize multiplied by the item count.\n\nThe `partial` pipeline uses `runtime_metrics: normal` and opts only the\nsampler into `item_counts` and `size`:\n\n| Node boundary | Messages (logs / metrics / traces) | Items (logs /\nmetrics / traces) | Size in By (logs / metrics / traces) |\n| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |\n| Receiver produced | 4 / 2 / 2 | Not present | Not present |\n| Sampler consumed | 4 / 2 / 2 | 30 / 18 / 12 | 7,472 / 3,710 / 2,290 |\n| Sampler produced | 4 / 2 / 2 | 10 / 18 / 12 | 6,448 / 3,710 / 2,290 |\n| Noop consumed | 4 / 2 / 2 | Not present | Not present |\n\n## Related issue\n\n* Closes #2884\n\n## Validation\n\nLocal engine runs\n\n## User-facing changes\n\nYes. Users can enable node-level logical payload size metrics globally\nwith `runtime_metrics: detailed` or per node with\n`policies.telemetry.size: true`.",

          "message": "feat(engine): Add opt-in `size` metric to node produced/consumed (#3842)\n\n# Change summary\n\nClosing the loop on final piece to match the [Go Collector universal\ntelemetry RFC on auto-instrumented\nmetrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/docs/rfcs/component-universal-telemetry.md#auto-instrumented-metrics)\n🥳\n\nAdds logical payload size to the engine-owned node outcome metrics:\n\n- `node.producer.produced.size{signal,outcome}`\n- `node.consumer.consumed.size{signal,outcome}`\n\nSize follows the existing item-count policy model. `runtime_metrics:\ndetailed` enables both measurements for every node. At `runtime_metrics:\nnormal`, nodes can independently opt in with:\n\n```yaml\npolicies:\n  telemetry:\n    size: true\n```\n\nThe forward path measures the payload once at each produced or consumed\nboundary and stores the value on the context frame. Ack/Nack unwinding\nrecords the stored size with the same signal and outcome as the\ncorresponding message metric.\n\nOTLP payloads report their encoded protobuf length. OTAP payloads report\nlogical Arrow bytes. Cached OTAP sizing avoids repeating the Arrow array\nand buffer walk when the payload is unchanged.\n\nThe `trafficgen-universal-produced-consumed-metrics.yaml` demo includes\nboth item and size policies and prints only produced/consumed node\nmetrics through its internal observability pipeline.\n\n### Sample config run\n\nThe `full` pipeline uses `runtime_metrics: detailed`. Its log sampler\nkeeps one third of log records while metrics and traces pass through\nunchanged:\n\n| Signal | Receiver produced | Sampler consumed | Sampler produced |\nNoop consumed |\n| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |\n| Logs messages | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 |\n| Logs items | 30 | 30 | 10 | 10 |\n| Logs size (By) | 7,472 | 7,472 | 6,448 | 6,448 |\n| Metrics messages | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |\n| Metrics items | 18 | 18 | 18 | 18 |\n| Metrics size (By) | 3,710 | 3,710 | 3,710 | 3,710 |\n| Traces messages | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |\n| Traces items | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 |\n| Traces size (By) | 2,290 | 2,290 | 2,290 | 2,290 |\n\nDropping two thirds of the log records reduces logical size from `7,472\nBy` to `6,448 By` rather than by two thirds. OTAP is a columnar,\nrelational representation: resource, scope, attribute, and dictionary\nbuffers remain largely unchanged, while sampling removes primarily the\nper-record offsets and dictionary keys. The synthetic records also\nrepeat values that are stored once in dictionaries. Logical Arrow size\ntherefore describes the resulting representation, not an average record\nsize multiplied by the item count.\n\nThe `partial` pipeline uses `runtime_metrics: normal` and opts only the\nsampler into `item_counts` and `size`:\n\n| Node boundary | Messages (logs / metrics / traces) | Items (logs /\nmetrics / traces) | Size in By (logs / metrics / traces) |\n| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |\n| Receiver produced | 4 / 2 / 2 | Not present | Not present |\n| Sampler consumed | 4 / 2 / 2 | 30 / 18 / 12 | 7,472 / 3,710 / 2,290 |\n| Sampler produced | 4 / 2 / 2 | 10 / 18 / 12 | 6,448 / 3,710 / 2,290 |\n| Noop consumed | 4 / 2 / 2 | Not present | Not present |\n\n## Related issue\n\n* Closes #2884\n\n## Validation\n\nLocal engine runs\n\n## User-facing changes\n\nYes. Users can enable node-level logical payload size metrics globally\nwith `runtime_metrics: detailed` or per node with\n`policies.telemetry.size: true`.",

All node rows have\n`outcome=success`.\n\nThe `full` pipeline enables detailed node metrics and a one-processor\nflow around `sampler`:\n\n```text\nreceiver output\n      │\n      ├── sampler node input == flow input\n      │            30 logs in\n      │            20 logs dropped\n      │            10 logs out\n      └── sampler node output == flow output == noop node input\n```\n\nNode and flow metric sets are stacked in pipeline order.

This demonstrates that an ACK without a send\nfinalizes flow compute and drop accounting without inventing an output\nmessage.\n\n## User-facing changes\n\nReplace:\n\n- `node.consumer.consumed.*` with `node.input.*`\n- `node.producer.produced.*` with `node.output.*`\n- `flow.consumed.*` with `flow.input.*`\n- `flow.produced.*` with `flow.output.*`\n- Flow metric configuration values based on consumed/produced\nterminology with `input_messages`, `input_items`, `input_size`,\n`output_messages`, `output_items`, and `output_size`.\n- Scope selectors targeting the previous names with the corresponding\ninput/output scopes.\n\nTreat `flow.compute.duration` values as seconds and as histogram\nobservations.",

Neither could express \"the\nclient sent bad data.\"\n\n## Related issue\n\n* Closes #3826 \n\n## Validation\n\n- Unit tests\n\n## User-facing changes\n\n| Failure | Before | After |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Client-caused permanent rejection | `503` / `UNAVAILABLE` (HTTP),\n`INTERNAL` (gRPC) | `400` / `INVALID_ARGUMENT` |\n| Permanent server-side failure | `503` / `INTERNAL` | `500` /\n`INTERNAL` |\n| Transient failure | `503` / `UNAVAILABLE` | `503` / `UNAVAILABLE`\n(unchanged) |\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Utkarsh Umesan Pillai <utpilla@users.noreply.github.com>",

Previously, if\none unresolved bundle kept a segment until retention expiry, the entire\nsegment was reported as lost—including bundles that downstream exporters\nhad already ACKed.\n\n```text\nsegment selected by retention\n├── bundle 0: unresolved  -> logical loss\n└── bundle 1: ACKed       -> excluded from logical loss\n\nphysical segment removal  -> reclaimed storage\n```\n\nRetention now snapshots the union of unresolved bundle indices across\nsubscribers while force-completing the segment under the same\nsubscriber-state lock. Each stored bundle is counted once when any\nsubscriber still needs it, avoiding both ACK races and per-subscriber\ndouble counting.\n\nThe segment manifest now includes an optional nullable `byte_count` for\neach bundle:\n\n- OTAP records use their active-range Arrow logical size\n- OTLP pass-through records use encoded protobuf wire length\n- known zero remains distinct from an unavailable count\n- loss bytes are emitted only when the selected unresolved bundles all\nhave exact counts\n\nThe manifest change is additive. New readers treat a missing\n`byte_count` column as unavailable, while existing readers continue\nlocating known fields by name and ignore the additional column.\n\n## Related issue\n\n* Closes #3892 \n\n## Validation\n\nRegression coverage exercises:\n\n- a partially ACKed segment, verifying only its unresolved bundle\ncontributes bundles, items, and logical bytes to expiry loss\n- a fully ACKed later segment retained behind an incomplete predecessor,\nverifying resolved data is excluded from expiry loss\n- multiple subscribers with overlapping unresolved bundles, verifying\nunion semantics count each stored bundle once\n- startup expiry after subscriber progress restoration, verifying\npersisted ACKs remain excluded\n- immediate, deferred, retried, and abandoned physical deletion,\nverifying reclaimed counters advance only after confirmed removal\n- nullable manifest byte counts, including known zero, known nonzero,\nunavailable counts, and legacy manifests without the new column\n- canonical OTAP active-range and OTLP protobuf-wire byte measurements\n\nA standalone mixed-segment repro sends one log bundle and one metric\nbundle through the same durable buffer, ACKs one downstream, transiently\nNACKs the other, and waits for the segment to expire.\n\n### Single-item batches\n\n| Unresolved bundle | `reclaimed.segments` | `reclaimed.bytes` |\n`loss.bundles` | `loss.bytes` | `loss.items` |\n| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |\n| 1 log | 1 `reason=expired` | 7,344 `reason=expired` | 1\n`reason=expired` | 359 `reason=expired` | 1 `signal=logs,\nreason=expired` |\n| 1 metric datapoint | 1 `reason=expired` | 7,344 `reason=expired` | 1\n`reason=expired` | 329 `reason=expired` | 1 `signal=metrics,\nreason=expired` |\n\n### 100-item batches\n\n| Unresolved bundle | `reclaimed.segments` | `reclaimed.bytes` |\n`loss.bundles` | `loss.bytes` | `loss.items` |\n| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |\n| 100 logs | 1 `reason=expired` | 57,840 `reason=expired` | 1\n`reason=expired` | 24,248 `reason=expired` | 100 `signal=logs,\nreason=expired` |\n| 100 metric datapoints | 1 `reason=expired` | 57,840 `reason=expired` |\n1 `reason=expired` | 26,952 `reason=expired` | 100 `signal=metrics,\nreason=expired` |\n\nFor the 100-item run, the segment contained 51,200 logical payload bytes\nand 6,640 bytes of Arrow IPC and Quiver segment overhead:\n\n```text\n57,840 physical bytes reclaimed\n├── 24,248 logical log bytes\n├── 26,952 logical metric bytes\n└──  6,640 segment encoding overhead\n```\n\nIn every permutation, the physical segment size remained constant while\n`loss.bytes` changed to match only the unresolved bundle.

Open **Preview**, then [use the chore\ntemplate](?template=chore.md).\n\n<!--Replace with a brief summary of the change in this PR-->\n\n## Related issue\nNone\n\n## Validation\nValidated locally while debugging issues like `400 Bad Request`, `503\nServer Unavailable` etc.\n\n## User-facing changes\n\n<!--\nDescribe the impact, or write `None`.\nUser-facing changes require a `.chloggen/*.yaml` entry.

          "message": "Avoid quadratic resource/scope lookups in OTAP trace view (#3936)\n\n`OtapTracesView` looks up the first spans-batch row for each resource\nand scope (to read the resource and scope name, version, and\ndropped-attribute counts) by scanning `resource_groups` and\n`scope_groups_map` on every call. Those accessors run once per resource\nand once per scope, so on a batch with G distinct resources and S\ndistinct scopes the repeated scans add up to O(G^2) and O(S^2).\n\nEach `OtapResourceSpansView` / `OtapScopeSpansView` is already handed\nthe `RowGroup` for its id when the view is built. The fix carries that\ngroup's first row onto the resource/scope view and reads it directly in\nthe accessors, so each lookup is O(1) with no extra maps and no derived\nstate to keep in sync — the grouping the view already does stays the\nonly pass over the rows.\n\nThis should not change any behavior. Resource and scope ids are assigned\nmonotonically per batch, so each id maps to exactly one group, and that\ngroup's first row is the same row the previous scan resolved. The\nexisting `views::otap::traces` unit tests already exercise\nmulti-resource and multi-scope batches.\n\nI only touched the traces view here. `metrics.rs` has the same pattern,\nso I can follow up with the same change there if that's useful.\n\n---------\n\nSigned-off-by: Uros Stefanovic <uros.stefanovic@databricks.com>\nCo-authored-by: albertlockett <a.lockett@f5.com>",

Even if the total payload volume falls within the\nconfigured connection and stream flow-control windows, each independent\nfragment incurs memory overhead due to internal tracking structures and\nqueue allocation.\n\nRepeated fragmentation massively inflates the heap space consumed by the\nstream. An attacker multiplexing multiple concurrent streams can exhaust\nthe memory bounds of the runtime, forcing a runtime panic or OutOfMemory\ncondition and leading to a remote Denial of Service (DoS).\n\n##### Patches\nThe change to fix this issue is merged in `master` and a patch release,\n1.83.1, has been published that contains this fix.\n\n##### Workarounds\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by implementing receive buffer\ncompaction.

          "message": "fix: inserting new attributes when no previous attributes did exist (#3982)\n\n# Change summary\n\nFixes two related issues related to inserting new attributes when none\ndid previously exist.\n\nThe first issue was that, when using the transform processor, if writing\na program like:\n```\nlogs | set attributes[\"x\"] = \"y\"\n```\nIf some input batch had no existing attribute record batch, a new one\nwould be created but we wouldn't set the schema metadata to indicate\nthat parent_id the column was not delta encoded. So when we decoded that\nto OTLP, we'd treat it as a delta encoded column and the net effect\nwould be that some attributes would end up missing from the result.\n\nThe second issue is somewhat similar - when inserting attributes using\nthe attribute processor we'd create a new attribute record batch, this\ntime with the correct parent_id encoding, but we'd also create a new ID\ncolumn for the root batch and this did not have indicator that said it\nwas not delta encoded.\n\nThis PR \n- corrects the behaviour to add the proper encoding metadata to the\nid/parent_id columns\n- updates tests so that our tests cover regressions agains these kind of\nerrors\n- adds a check in the upsert attributes helper function to ensure it is\npassed an attribute record batch with plain encoded parent_ids.\n\n<!--Replace with a brief summary of the change in this PR-->\n\n## Related issue\n\n<!--We highly recommend correlation of every PR to an issue-->\n\n* Closes #3985\n\n## Validation\n\nUnit tests\n\n<!--How did you confirm your change has the intended effect?-->\n\n## User-facing changes\n\nno\n\n<!--\nDescribe the impact, or write `None`.\nUser-facing changes require a `.chloggen/*.yaml` entry.

Current output consumes `otlp`; `otap` reserves the same\nsurface for\nplanned OTAP log output.\n\n```yaml\nlogs:\n  otap: {}\n  otlp:\n    min_size: 65536\n    max_size: 2097152\n    sizer: bytes\n  max_batch_duration: 200ms\n```\n\nBoth format blocks use optional `min_size` and `max_size` plus `sizer`.\nCurrent\nOTLP output validates `bytes` sizing with the batch processor's\nconfiguration\nmodel. The reserved OTAP settings are parsed but remain inactive and\nunvalidated until OTAP output is implemented.\n\n## Benchmark\n\nA new `self_tracing` benchmark compares the previous one-request-per-log\nencoding path with one scope-grouped request per batch.\n\n| Records | Scopes | Per record | Grouped batch | Speedup |\n|--------:|-------:|-----------:|--------------:|--------:|\n| 1 | 1 | 579.86 ns | 617.13 ns | 0.94x |\n| 8 | 1 | 4.281 us | 1.189 us | 3.60x |\n| 8 | 8 | 4.291 us | 1.818 us | 2.36x |\n| 64 | 1 | 34.475 us | 5.179 us | 6.66x |\n| 64 | 8 | 34.207 us | 10.127 us | 3.38x |\n| 64 | 64 | 34.659 us | 10.444 us | 3.32x |\n| 512 | 1 | 285.26 us | 35.835 us | 7.96x |\n| 512 | 8 | 282.93 us | 90.356 us | 3.13x |\n| 512 | 512 | 289.01 us | 80.835 us | 3.58x |\n\n## Credit\n\nThis is a fresh implementation on current `main` of the problem\naddressed by\n#3374.

          "message": "chore(otlp_receiver): adjust rate limit test parameters for deterministic behavior (#3984)\n\n# Change summary\n\nFix the flakiness in `test_otlp_grpc_transient_rate_limit_rejection` by\nkeeping its rate-limit bucket deterministically saturated for the\nduration of the test.\n\nThe test pre-consumes the bucket and expects the next request to be\nrejected by the gRPC pre-decode saturation check. The original policy\nallowed one request-sized burst per second. Because bucket capacity\nrefills continuously, even a small scheduling delay could restore the\nsingle unit checked by the saturation probe. The request would then\nproceed to the weighted admission check, where it was still rejected but\nreturned  grpc-retry-pushback-ms: 1000 . This conflicted with the\nexpected fast-rejection response, which intentionally has no\nrequest-specific retry guidance.\n\nThe test now configures a one-unit-per-hour refill rate while retaining\nthe request-sized burst. This preserves the behavior under test but\nprevents wall-clock scheduling from selecting a different rejection\npath.\n\nThe shutdown signal is also sent immediately after the RPC completes,\nbefore response assertions. Previously, an assertion failure skipped\nshutdown and left the receiver running until nextest terminated the test\nafter 120 seconds, obscuring the original assertion failure as a\ntimeout.\n\n## Related issue\n\nAddresses the OTLP receiver flake reported in #2720\n\n## Validation\n\nRan 50 iterations of `test_otlp_grpc_transient_rate_limit_rejection`\nsuccessfully\n\n## User-facing changes\n\nNone. This is a test-only change.",

This is caused\nby `contrib` `geneva_exporter` usage of a library that has its own\ndependency on the `pdata-views` crate.\n\n- Keep `otel-arrow-dfe-pdata-views` at its current independent version\nduring normal releases\n- Add a Prepare Release opt-in for coordinated `pdata-views` version\nbumps\n- Allow crates.io publication tooling to validate and skip independently\nversioned crates outside the requested release\n- List only crates matching the requested version in generated release\nnotes\n- Document the independent release policy and external-consumer\ncompatibility requirement\n\nMoving forward, we should think about declaring `1.0.0` stability on\nthis crate so consumers can depend on `1` (meaning `>= 1.0.0 and <\n2.0.0`).\n\n## Related issue\n\nN/A",

          "message": "chore(pdata): establish pluggable PData codec foundations (#3942)\n\n# Change summary\n\nThis PR establishes the codec and runtime foundations for a five-PR\nseries implementing pluggable PData codecs in the OTel Arrow Dataflow\nEngine.\n\nToday, `OtapPdata` supports native OTAP records and an OTLP-specific\nbyte representation. That representation allows transparent processors\nto forward OTLP without decoding and re-encoding it, but the\noptimization cannot be extended to other independently decodable\nformats.\n\nThe series generalizes that mechanism while preserving its performance\nand ownership properties:\n\n1. **Codec and runtime foundations**  \nDefine the codec model, add the built-in OTLP codec, inject\nruntime-owned codec access through effect handlers, and establish the\nperformance baseline. Existing payload storage and node behavior remain\nunchanged.\n\n2. **Encoded payload capabilities and node migration**  \nAdd generalized encoded payload storage and recoverable capability APIs,\nthen migrate core, contrib, and WASM consumers to\nrepresentation-independent inspection, views, native conversion, and\nstartup-resolved output encoding.\n\n3. **Codec-aware batching**  \nAllow codecs to batch compatible encoded payloads without materializing\nOTAP, with an OTAP fallback when native batching is unavailable.\n\n4. **OTLP activation and transitional cleanup**  \nMove OTLP HTTP and gRPC receivers onto the generalized codec path,\npreserve matching-format forwarding, and remove OTLP-specific storage\nand obsolete APIs.\n\n5. **Syslog extensibility proof**  \nAdd a decode-only syslog/CEF codec whose receiver preserves and batches\noriginal messages until native processing is required.\n\nParquet and other representations are left for later work.\n\n### Full-series reference performance\n\nThe table below evaluates the complete five-PR reference implementation,\nnot this foundation PR in isolation. \"Before\" is the series base\n(`9a2b51e7`); \"after\" is the cleaned PR 5 tip (`d8e3125d`). Rates are\nmedian successfully delivered log records per second. Changes are the\ngeometric mean of five paired after/before ratios, with 95% paired t\nintervals.\n\n| Path | 1 CPU before | 1 CPU after | 1 CPU change (95% CI) | 4 CPUs\nbefore | 4 CPUs after | 4 CPU change (95% CI) |\n| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |\n| OTLP gRPC -> OTLP gRPC | 0.449 M/s | 0.450 M/s | +1.1% (-1.6% to\n+3.8%) | 1.803 M/s | 1.802 M/s | -0.3% (-1.9% to +1.3%) |\n| OTAP gRPC -> OTAP gRPC | 3.525 M/s | 3.560 M/s | +0.8% (-1.0% to\n+2.6%) | 9.338 M/s | 9.252 M/s | -1.0% (-4.5% to +2.7%) |\n| Syslog RFC 3164/TCP -> OTAP gRPC | 0.329 M/s | 0.325 M/s | -2.0%\n(-3.9% to -0.1%) | 1.339 M/s | 1.286 M/s | -4.6% (-7.3% to -1.9%) |\n\nThe controlled logs-only workload uses 1,000-record batches, 1,024-byte\nbodies, loopback transports, no processors, and no transport or Arrow\ncompression. Only the SUT binary changes; senders and backends use the\nbefore binary. The SUT is pinned to CPU 14 for one-core runs and CPUs\n10-13 for four-core runs, with generators and backends on separate\nphysical cores. All runs completed without failed or refused batches.\nThe OTLP and OTAP intervals include zero; the measurements therefore do\nnot establish a throughput change for those paths. The Syslog result\nshows a small measurable cost in the full codec path.\n\n### Design principles\n\n- Native OTAP remains the common mutable processing representation and\nthe intermediate representation for cross-codec conversion.\n- Codecs represent independently decodable byte formats and may support\ndecoding, encoding, or both.\n- Conversion remains lazy. Transparent nodes preserve the original\nrepresentation, while native consumers request OTAP explicitly.\n- Payloads contain codec identity, signal, bytes, counts, and delivery\ncontext, but never mutable codec state.\n- Codec instances and reusable buffers belong to the single-threaded\npipeline runtime, are created lazily, and are accessed through effect\nhandlers.\n- Codec failures preserve the original message and its Ack/Nack\nownership for rejection or retry.\n- Admission and matching-format forwarding must not instantiate codecs,\ncopy the underlying `Bytes`, or allocate a per-message codec wrapper.\n- Reusable buffers have bounded retained capacity, and signal-specific\nstate is allocated only when used.\n- Encoding identity includes incompatible format versions and intrinsic\ncompression. HTTP and gRPC compression remain transport concerns.\n- Output selection is resolved explicitly at startup. Automatic\nrepresentation negotiation and predicate/projection pushdown are outside\nthis series.\n\n### This PR\n\nThis first PR provides the foundations needed by later migrations\nwithout changing `PayloadData`, receiver admission, or node processing\nbehavior.\n\nIt introduces:\n\n- Legacy-path benchmarks for forwarding, conversion, batching,\ncompression, syslog parsing, allocation, and layout.\n- The new `otel-arrow-dfe-pdata-codec` crate, which centralizes codec\nidentity, contracts, registration, plans, and runtime lifecycle without\ndepending on the pipeline engine or delivery context.\n- `PdataEncoding`, validated link-time registration, codec capability\nmetadata, and startup resolution through `ResolvedCodec`.\n- Separate decoder and encoder contracts, prepared output, borrowed\nviews, and stateless item counting, allowing one-sided codecs without\ndummy operations.\n- A codec-level `EncodedPdata` envelope used by codec APIs and tests. It\nis not yet a `PayloadData` variant.\n- A built-in OTLP codec for logs, metrics, and traces, with lazy\nper-signal state and bounded retained buffers.\n- `EncodePolicy` and startup-resolved `EncodingPlan` for explicit output\nselection.\n- One lazy `CodecService` in each `PipelineRuntimeServices`, exposed\nuniformly through the `CodecEffectHandler` interface for receiver,\nprocessor, and exporter effect handlers.\n- Codec conformance tests and Criterion benchmarks comparing direct\ncodec behavior with the existing OTLP implementation.\n\nExisting OTLP receivers continue producing `OtlpBytes`, and\n`PayloadData` still contains only its existing storage variants.\nGeneralized payload storage, recoverable payload capabilities, node\nmigration, codec-aware batching, OTLP activation, and syslog integration\nremain in later PRs.\n\n## Related issue\n\n- Part of #3452\n\n## Validation\n\n- `cargo check -p otel-arrow-dfe-pdata-codec -p otel-arrow-dfe-engine -p\notel-arrow-dfe-otap -p otel-arrow-dfe-core-nodes -p\notel-arrow-dfe-contrib-nodes`\n- `cargo test -p otel-arrow-dfe-pdata-codec`\n- `cargo check -p benchmarks --all-targets`\n\n## User-facing changes\n\nNone. This PR adds internal codec and runtime infrastructure, tests, and\nbenchmarks without changing pipeline configuration or wire behavior.",

          "message": "feat(context): compile transport header policies (#4008)\n\n###\n\nTransport header policies are re-implemented. This replaces #3934, which\nfell apart for not accomplishing anything real. This PR makes a first\nstep in optimizing the transport headers implementation, as such it is\nmore complete.\n\nThis PR compiles information about whether any consumer uses the\noriginal form of a transport header. When no consumer uses the transport\nheaders original name, the original name is omitted from the context.\n\nThis requires:\n\n1. New `ContextEntryName` is a config struct entry that checks a few\nrequirements for transport header names and normalizes them to ASCII\nlowercase. (This was existing behavior, now encapsulated in a type.)\n2. Transport headers are now a pair of `ContextEntryName` and value,\nwhere value is the optional original name, value type, and value bytes.\nNote we use `Box<[u8]>` and `Box<str>` to save one word per container,\nsince these are immutable after calculation.\n3. Transport header policies now include `ContextEntryName` fields,\nmeans less error checking and validation\n4. Kafka exporter/receiver work: declare context uses, accept\n`ContextEntryName`, etc. (see benchmarks)\n5. Controller/live_control: compile immutable engine-wide context\nruntime requirements and distribute per-generation compiled bindings via\nPipelineContext\n6. OTLP/grpc, partition processor, transform processor, OTAP, validation\nnodes etc. all add context declarations\n7. New `crates/engine/src/context_declaration.rs` separates immutable\nruntime requirements from per-generation compiled context bindings\n\nThe benchmarks change for three reasons:\n\n1. Avoiding the original header name when not required\n2. Re-using an intermediate Vec<_> when capturing headers\n3. Using a HashMap<_, _> instead of a linear scan to locate match rules\n(note case-insensitive hash function, since we hash and compare original\nvalue)\n\nNew benchmark results below.\n\nBenchmark methodology: Criterion point estimates with 100 samples, a\n3-second warmup, and a 5-second measurement period, pinned to CPU 1 on\nan otherwise idle Intel Core Ultra 7 165H system. gRPC receive cells\nwere measured individually with each upstream comparison adjacent;\nend-to-end and Kafka cases were grouped by header count.\n\n### gRPC receive, renamed / original-name consumer\n\n| Revision | 1 | 4 | 16 | 32 |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n| upstream/main `f7d3913ce` | 213.94 ns | 516.79 ns | 1.962 us | 5.352\nus |\n| current `68392a415` | 86.78 ns | 349.76 ns | 1.116 us | 2.411 us |\n| Delta | -59.4% | -32.3% | -43.1% | -54.9% |\n\n### gRPC end-to-end, renamed / original-name consumer\n\n| Revision | 1 | 4 | 16 | 32 |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n| upstream/main `f7d3913ce` | 325.53 ns | 930.05 ns | 5.832 us | 12.53\nus |\n| current `68392a415` | 183.94 ns | 664.91 ns | 3.303 us | 7.055 us |\n| Delta | -43.5% | -28.5% | -43.4% | -43.7% |\n\n### gRPC receive\n\nStored-name consumers are omitted here because receive-only capture\ncompiles identically to the no-consumer case; propagation differences\nappear in the end-to-end table.\n\n| Producer / original-name retention | 1 | 4 | 16 | 32 |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n| Unrenamed / omit | 85.11 ns | 272.35 ns | 973.85 ns | 1.923 us |\n| Unrenamed / preserve | 74.74 ns | 317.37 ns | 1.022 us | 1.922 us |\n| Renamed / omit | 74.41 ns | 281.94 ns | 1.015 us | 1.851 us |\n| Renamed / preserve | 86.78 ns | 349.76 ns | 1.116 us | 2.411 us |\n\n### gRPC end-to-end\n\n| Producer / consumer | 1 | 4 | 16 | 32 |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n| Unrenamed / none | 94.07 ns | 330.13 ns | 1.178 us | 3.188 us |\n| Unrenamed / stored-name | 152.77 ns | 636.36 ns | 2.905 us | 6.239 us\n|\n| Unrenamed / original-name | 172.70 ns | 628.94 ns | 3.210 us | 6.282\nus |\n| Renamed / none | 101.47 ns | 344.21 ns | 1.630 us | 2.638 us |\n| Renamed / stored-name | 166.93 ns | 633.69 ns | 3.064 us | 6.638 us |\n| Renamed / original-name | 183.94 ns | 664.91 ns | 3.303 us | 7.055 us\n|\n\n### Kafka receive, original names\n\n| Implementation | 1 | 4 | 16 | 32 |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n| Legacy enum | 101.07 ns | 366.97 ns | 2.429 us | 6.680 us |\n| Current value | 98.67 ns | 448.05 ns | 2.150 us | 6.337 us |\n| Delta | -2.4% | +22.1% | -11.5% | -5.1% |\n\n### Kafka end-to-end, original names\n\n| Implementation | 1 | 4 | 16 | 32 |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n| Legacy enum | 155.42 ns | 479.92 ns | 2.963 us | 8.702 us |\n| Current value | 161.52 ns | 512.91 ns | 2.639 us | 7.658 us |\n| Delta | +3.9% | +6.9% | -10.9% | -12.0% |\n\n### Transport header layout\n\n| Representation | Size | Delta |\n|---|---:|---:|\n| Legacy enum | 64 bytes | - |\n| Current value | 56 bytes | -12.5% |\n\n\nPart of #3919\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>\nCo-authored-by: Maksat Maratov <mmaratov@microsoft.com>",

Its proposed\nfilter-specific counters answered whether batches arrived and how many\nitems survived, while configured-path counters indicated only that a\nbatch arrived while an `include` or `exclude` rule was configured.\n\nThose requirements are now covered without duplicating throughput\ninstrumentation:\n\n| Requirement | Metric or source |\n| --- | --- |\n| Batches and items received | `node.input.messages` and\n`node.input.items` |\n| Items kept and forwarded | `node.output.items` |\n| Items filtered | `processor.filter.dropped.items` |\n| Include/exclude configuration | Node configuration |\n\nA configured-path counter would be equivalent to repeating node input\ncounts with a static configuration flag. It would not indicate that\nfiltering completed or that any rule matched, so this change does not\ncarry that counter forward from #3268.\n\n## Related issue\n\n<!--We highly recommend correlation of every PR to an issue-->\n\n- Closes #3053\n- Closes #3649\n\n## Validation\n\nUnit tests\n\n## User-facing changes\n\nMigration: Rename `processor.filter.pdata.dropped.items` to\n`processor.filter.dropped.items`.",

          "message": "Implement resource and scope metadata in the OTAP logs view (#3993)\n\n# Change summary\n\n`OtapLogsView` never implemented the resource- and scope-level metadata\naccessors. `name()`, `version()`, `schema_url()` and\n`dropped_attributes_count()` on the resource and scope views just\nreturned `None` or `0` behind `// TODO`s, even though `OtapTracesView`\nand `OtapMetricsView` already read these straight from the batch. So a\nlogs batch traversed through the OTAP view silently dropped the\ninstrumentation-scope name and version, the resource and scope schema\nURLs, and the resource/scope dropped-attribute counts.\n\nThis fills them in the same way the traces and metrics views already do.\nThe resource and scope struct columns (plus the root `schema_url`\ncolumn) are cached once when the view is built, and each\n`OtapResourceLogsView` / `OtapScopeLogsView` already holds the\n`RowGroup` for its id, so the accessors just read the shared value from\nthat group's first row. Lookups stay O(1) with no extra maps and no\nderived state to keep in sync.\n\nTwo details worth a look.\n\n- The `ScopeLogs` `schema_url` comes from the root logs batch column,\nand the resource `schema_url` from the resource struct column, matching\nthe traces view. (The old stub comment hinted at a scope-id lookup,\nwhich would have been wrong.)\n- Resource and scope ids are assigned monotonically per batch, so each\nid maps to exactly one group and that group's first row is the\nrepresentative row.\n\nI mirrored the trace (#3936) and metrics (#3964) view changes rather\nthan introducing anything new. Only the previously stubbed\nresource/scope metadata is filled in; the log-record fields are\nunchanged.\n\n## Related issue\n\nNo dedicated tracking issue. This is the logs counterpart to the trace\n(#3936) and metrics (#3964) view work.\n\n## Validation\n\nMirrors the already-merged `OtapTracesView` / `OtapMetricsView`\naccessors. The existing `views::otap::logs` unit tests exercise\nmulti-resource and multi-scope traversal, and CI runs the full\n`otap-df-pdata` test suite.\n\n## User-facing changes\n\nConsumers of the OTAP logs view now get real instrumentation-scope\n`name` and `version`, resource and scope `schema_url`, and\nresource/scope `dropped_attributes_count` instead of `None` or `0`. A\nchangelog entry is included\n(`.chloggen/implement-otap-logs-scope-resource-metadata.yaml`).\n\n---------\n\nSigned-off-by: Uros Stefanovic <uros.stefanovic@databricks.com>\nCo-authored-by: albertlockett <a.lockett@f5.com>",

That only works if it\ndowncasts against the same Arrow version pdata used to build the batch,\nand if the caller is on a different (usually newer) Arrow version it\njust fails.\n\nRight now there's no way to get at pdata's Arrow types from outside the\ncrate. You end up adding your own `arrow` dependency and hoping it stays\non the same version as pdata, which tends to break quietly the next time\npdata bumps Arrow.\n\nThis re-exports the `arrow` crate as\n`otel_arrow_dfe_pdata::otap::arrow`, so callers can reach the exact\nArrow that built the batches through pdata. It's a one-line `pub use`.\n\n---------\n\nSigned-off-by: Uros Stefanovic <uros.stefanovic@databricks.com>",

          "message": "chore(docs): Improve shared Receiver and Exporter boundary metric cardinality documentation (#4079)\n\n# Chore summary\n\nImplementing the shared receiver and exporter metrics in the first few\nnodes exposed work shapes more complex than one PData message mapping to\none external message or submission. Fan-out, aggregation, many-to-many\nbatching, retries, generated data, and asynchronous buffering require\nnode authors to make explicit decisions about metric cardinality,\ntiming, and ACK/NACK ownership.\n\nThis adds that guidance to the telemetry metrics guide, with concise\npointers from the OTAP crate and operator documentation. It\ndistinguishes external work from PData work, logical batches from\nnode-local attempts, and pushed ingress from receiver-initiated\ngeneration.\n\n### Cardinality guidance\n\n`R = receiver.received.messages`, `O = node.output.messages`, `I =\nnode.input.messages`, and `A = exporter.attempted.messages`.\n\n| Work shape | Receiver boundary | Exporter boundary |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1:1 | `R=1`, `O=1`: one external message produces one PData message. |\n`I=1`, `A=1`: one PData message produces one node-local delivery\nattempt. |\n| 1:N | `R=1`, `O=N`: record one local outcome for the external message.\n| `I=1`, `A=N`: record each external submission independently when\nfan-out succeeds. |\n| N:1 | `R=N`, `O=1`: record each external message independently. |\n`I=N`, `A=1`: record the external batch rather than each contributing\nPData message. |\n| N:M | `R=N`, `O=M`: track external-message-to-PData ownership\nindependently. | `I=N`, `A=M`: track logical batches for ACK/NACK and\nrecord each node-local attempt independently. |\n\nReceivers without independently classifiable external messages can have\n`R=0`, `O=N`; they omit `receiver.received` rather than inventing\nexternal messages.\n\nCurrent node mappings:\n\n- **OTLP receiver (#4044) -- 1:1:** each HTTP or gRPC request produces\none PData message, so `R=1` and `O=1`.\n- **OTLP HTTP and gRPC exporters (#4044) -- 1:1:** each PData message\nproduces one request, so `I=1` and `A=1`; preparation failures still\nrecord one attempt.\n- **Syslog receiver (#3899) -- N:1:** each framed TCP message or UDP\ndatagram records a received outcome, while several accepted messages can\nform one PData batch, so `R=N` and `O=1`.\n- **Azure Monitor exporter (#4059) -- N:M:** PData messages are\nregrouped across logical gzip batches, so ACK/NACK follows explicit\nPData-to-batch ownership while each physical submission and retry\nrecords an attempt.\n- **Geneva exporter (#4075) -- 1:N:** one PData message can produce\nseveral encoded upload batches, so `I=1` and `A=N`; sibling attempts own\nindependent sizes, item counts, and outcomes.\n\n## Related issue\n\n- Related to #3822",

          "message": "feat(pdata): add codec-aware batching (#4347)\n\n# Change summary\n\n**PR3 of the five-PR pluggable PData codec series**, following #4042.\n\nAdds batching as an optional codec capability. Encoded telemetry can be\nmerged and split without first materializing OTAP, and new formats can\nprovide batching support without adding format-specific branches to the\nbatch processor.\n\n## How it works\n\n- **Codec-native batching:** `PdataBatcher` produces independently\ndecodable batches. OTLP reuses the existing protobuf batching\nalgorithms.\n- **OTAP fallback:** `BatchPlan` resolves representations and sizing at\nstartup. Compatible item-based policies use native OTAP batching when\ncodec-native batching is unavailable; unsupported combinations are\nrejected.\n- **Explicit delivery ownership:** outputs identify their contributing\ninput ranges, including splits and merges. Inputs consumed without\noutput are accounted for separately. Ack/Nack tracking no longer depends\non additive byte or item counts; the processor retains delivery\ncontexts, buffering, flush deadlines, and backpressure.\n\nThe **purple batching path** extends the framework introduced by the\npreceding PRs:\n\n![PData forwarding, views, conversion, batching, and codec\nlifecycle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lquerel/otel-arrow/3a899d7b056a3787a7a82693b470f7b622245e2c/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/pdata-codec/assets/pdata-codec-framework.png)\n\nUnchanged forwarding retains the original bytes without creating a codec\ninstance. Encoded batching may create new buffers and reuse a batcher\ninstance, while avoiding OTAP materialization.\n\n## Remaining series\n\n- **PR4:** activate encoded OTLP, remove transitional storage, and\nexpose pipeline decode-policy configuration.\n- **PR5:** activate the syslog codec, enabling batching before syslog\nparsing and Arrow construction.\n\n## Related issue\n\n- Advances #3452.\n\n## Validation\n\n`cargo xtask check` passed \n\n### Full-engine benchmarks\n\n**No broad CPU or RSS regression is apparent.** CPU point estimates\ndiffer by less than 1% in every scenario.\n\n| Scenario | Pairs | Main CPU (us/log) | PR3 CPU (us/log) | CPU change\n(95% paired CI) | Main RSS (MiB) | PR3 RSS (MiB) |\n| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |\n| OTAP → OTAP | 4 | 1.7237 | 1.7188 | -0.29% [-2.53, +1.96] | 56.94 |\n57.15 |\n| OTLP → OTLP | 4 | 4.6525 | 4.6675 | +0.32% [-0.10, +0.74] | 45.41 |\n45.48 |\n| Syslog → OTAP | 4 | 6.8262 | 6.8113 | -0.22% [-1.31, +0.87] | 65.97 |\n66.09 |\n| HTTP gzip, 128 KiB | 4 | 6.3348 | 6.3260 | -0.14% [-0.60, +0.33] |\n53.33 | 53.20 |\n| HTTP gzip, 240 KiB | 4 | 6.2564 | 6.2589 | +0.04% [-0.28, +0.36] |\n53.20 | 52.17 |\n| HTTP gzip, 272 KiB | 4 | 6.1621 | 6.1571 | -0.08% [-0.40, +0.23] |\n52.84 | 51.66 |\n| HTTP gzip, 512 KiB | 4 | 6.0203 | 6.0353 | +0.25% [-0.93, +1.43] |\n54.33 | 53.11 |\n| HTTP gzip, 1 MiB | 4 | 5.5714 | 5.5664 | -0.09% [-2.30, +2.12] | 56.15\n| 54.67 |\n| HTTP gzip, 4 MiB | 4 | 4.5040 | 4.5427 | +0.86% [+0.49, +1.23] | 63.45\n| 61.55 |\n| gRPC gzip, 128 KiB | 4 | 6.2685 | 6.2860 | +0.28% [-0.21, +0.77] |\n51.42 | 50.81 |\n| gRPC gzip, 240 KiB | 4 | 6.2314 | 6.2314 | +0.00% [-0.18, +0.18] |\n52.66 | 51.00 |\n| gRPC gzip, 272 KiB | 4 | 6.1483 | 6.1521 | +0.06% [-0.39, +0.51] |\n52.69 | 50.96 |\n| gRPC gzip, 512 KiB | 4 | 6.0066 | 6.0141 | +0.13% [-0.37, +0.62] |\n54.00 | 52.22 |\n| gRPC gzip, 1 MiB | 4 | 5.6389 | 5.6014 | -0.66% [-2.21, +0.89] | 56.19\n| 54.40 |\n| gRPC gzip, 4 MiB | 1 | 4.5053 | 4.5227 | +0.39% (CI unavailable: one\npair) | 65.22 | 63.38 |\n\n## User-facing changes\n\nAdds per-codec batching profiles and output encoding selection.

Neither OTLP nor Go's receiver\nimposes these rules, so valid configs were rejected or silently changed.\nThis PR corrects that by relaxing the checks so that valid metric\ndefinitions are accepted and kept as written.\n\nFor example, valid configs rejected or changed before this PR:\n\n- (rejected) a definition named `% Processor Time`, because it doesn't\nstart with an ASCII letter.\n- (rejected) the unit `µs`, because it isn't ASCII.\n- (rejected) definitions `cpu.time` and `CPU.time` as duplicates, even\nthough lookup is case-sensitive.\n- (changed) a definition named `\"cpu.time \"` is published as\n`\"cpu.time\"`, because names, units and descriptions are trimmed.\n\nNative object, instance and counter names are unchanged here and will be\naddressed in a follow-up.\n\n- **Definition names:** accept any nonempty name as written, including\nUnicode, long, path-shaped, whitespace-only, padded and\ncontrol-character names. Go: same.\n- **`metric` references:** kept as written and looked up exactly and\ncase-sensitively. An omitted or empty reference uses the counter path.\nGo: same.\n- **Units:** kept as written. An omitted or empty unit defaults to\n`\"1\"`. Go: [intends the same\ndefault](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/c766745fdaed961d2559b1e2d5d9c468c85d3574/receiver/windowsperfcountersreceiver/config.go#L86-L88),\nbut leaves defined metrics with an empty unit.\n- **Descriptions:** kept as written. Go: same.\n- **`metrics: null`:** treated as no definitions. Go: same.\n- **Definition count:** no cap. Go: same. The receiver's existing 256\ncounter-path budget is unchanged.\n- **Case-only variants:** kept distinct, with one warning per group\nnaming every spelling. Go: kept distinct, no warning.\n- **Unused path-shaped definitions:** one warning each when no counter\nselects it, explicitly or by path. Go: silently ignored. Unused\ndefinitions emit nothing.\n- **Docs:** config documentation moved from the module header onto each\nfield.\n\n## Related issue\n\nPart of #4074.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>\nCo-authored-by: Joshua MacDonald <jmacd@users.noreply.github.com>\nCo-authored-by: Utkarsh Umesan Pillai <66651184+utpilla@users.noreply.github.com>\nCopilot-Session: 1699f46c-a707-4cd1-9a9e-a9a508d6dd81",

No\ntimestamp or offset cache is introduced.\n\nRFC 5424 and raw CEF parsing are unchanged. PR5's batch limits remain\n256 logs / 256 KiB; larger batches and cooperative codecs are separate\nwork.\n\nCodec configuration follows in PR6.\n\n## Related issue\n\n- Advances #3452.\n\n## Validation\n\n`cargo xtask check` and Clippy passed. \n\n### Full-engine benchmarks\n\nCompares upstream main against **PR5.1 only**, using identical release\nsettings and pipeline configuration.\nTCP syslog -> SUT receiver / batch / zstd OTAP exporter -> DFE backend,\nat 102,400 logs/s on one otherwise idle pinned CPU.\n\n| Input | Main CPU (us/log) | PR5.1 CPU (us/log) | CPU change (95%\npaired CI) | Mean RSS, main -> PR5.1 (MiB) |\n| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |\n| RFC 3164 | 6.5519 | 6.3275 | -3.42% [-3.56%, -3.29%] | 43.29 -> 43.32\n|\n| RFC 5424 | 6.3525 | 6.3475 | -0.08% [-0.33%, +0.17%] | 43.08 -> 43.42\n|\n\n**Important Note**: The earlier ~35% CPU reduction was measured with 8K\nbatches and included both PR5 and PR5.1. PR5 now limits synchronous\nsyslog batches to 256 logs / 256 KiB to protect pipeline responsiveness,\nwhich reduces the opportunity to amortize Arrow construction and export\ncosts. PR5.1 therefore keeps the timestamp optimization without relaxing\nthose limits. I intend to recover some of the larger-batch gains through\ncooperative codec execution: processing bounded chunks and yielding to\nI/O while retaining a larger logical batch, rather than monopolizing the\npipeline thread.\n\n## User-facing changes\n\nLower CPU usage for syslog ingestion and RFC 3164 timestamp conversion.\nNo configuration or protocol changes.

This PR makes collection\nsurvive failures: failed collections are retried, queries are rebuilt\nwhen needed, and counter state carries over. Operators get clear logs\nfor failures, limit hits, membership changes, and recoveries.\n\n## Commits\n\n1. **Worker and lifecycle** (f96ac30f3): Starts, stops, and cancels the\nworker, and owns the native query. Retries and rebuilds keep counter\nstate and do not emit partial data.\n2. **Diagnostics** (dfc1b1aec): Logs failures, limit hits, membership\nchanges, and recoveries. Ordinary counter warnings are logged once per\nepisode.\n3. **Live tests and native CI** (919dc8df1): Adds Windows-native tests\nfor collection, lifecycle, recovery, and projection. CI runs them\nserially and fails if a command fails or runs no tests.\n\n## Related issue\n\nPart of #4074.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>\nCopilot-Session: b57921b8-61e5-4fac-afae-a18d40bd60ae",

          "message": "chore(azure-data-explorer): Additional Skeleton for Azure Data Explorer exporter (#4464)\n\n# Change Summary\n\nThis is **PR 3 of the unified multi-signal Azure Data Explorer\nexporter**, building on the component foundation merged in #4311 and the\nbounded signal transformations added in #4382.\n\n`urn:microsoft:exporter:azure_data_explorer`\n\nThis phase adds the standalone, signal-agnostic HTTP transport client\nand telemetry contracts needed for ADX managed streaming ingestion.\n\nThe client implements bounded request attempts, retry handling,\noperation deadlines, response classification, and transport metrics for\nlogs, metrics, and traces. It accepts already transformed and\ngzip-compressed payloads produced by later runtime integration.\n\nThe exporter remains explicitly non-operational after this phase. The\nclient and metrics are not yet wired into the exporter loop, and\npipeline messages are not sent, acknowledged, or negatively\nacknowledged.\n\n## Signals Supported\n\nThe transport and telemetry contracts support batches for:\n\n- Logs\n- Metrics\n- Traces\n\nSignal transformation continues to use the bounded implementation\nintroduced in #4382.\n\n## Includes\n\n- A standalone HTTP client for the ADX managed streaming ingestion\nendpoint\n- Signal-agnostic client reuse across log, metric, and trace destination\ntables\n- Percent-encoding of database, table, and mapping names\n- JSON streaming-ingestion endpoint construction using\n`streamFormat=JSON`\n- Authorization, content type, gzip content encoding, and ADX\nclient-request headers\n- Stable operation IDs across retries with per-attempt request\nidentifiers\n- A total operation deadline covering:\n  - HTTP submission\n  - Response handling\n  - Retry backoff\n  - All physical attempts\n- Configurable retries after the initial submission\n- Exponential retry backoff with jitter:\n  - 3-second initial delay\n  - 30-second maximum delay\n- `Retry-After` support for both:\n  - Delta-seconds values\n  - HTTP-date values\n- Retry handling for:\n  - Network failures\n  - HTTP 408\n  - HTTP 429\n  - HTTP 5xx\n  - Retryable response-body failures\n- Error classification for:\n  - Retryable failures\n  - Backend refusals\n  - Permanent refusals\n  - Unauthorized responses\n- Bounded ADX error-response retention\n- UTF-8-safe response diagnostics\n- Optional response-body debug logging with:\n  - 512-byte chunks\n  - A maximum of 128 events per response\n  - No response content in warning-level events\n- Shared exporter-attempt telemetry for:\n  - Attempt count\n  - Duration\n  - Item count\n  - Payload size\n  - Signal\n  - Outcome\n- ADX-specific metrics for:\n  - Logical batch outcomes by signal\n  - HTTP attempts by bounded response category\n- Exactly one HTTP response category per physical attempt, including\nresponse-body timeouts\n- Pipeline-local `Rc<RefCell<_>>` metric ownership without shared\ncross-core state\n- Focused tests covering endpoint construction, headers, retries,\ndeadlines, response bounds, metric outcomes, and diagnostic-work limits\n\n## Resource, Runtime, and Correctness Requirements\n\n- The complete operation, including retries and backoff, must remain\nbounded by the configured timeout.\n- Retry delays must never extend beyond the operation deadline.\n- Error-response retention must remain bounded independently of\nserver-provided content length.\n- Optional diagnostic logging must have bounded bytes, allocations, and\nevent count.\n- One physical HTTP attempt must produce exactly one bounded\nHTTP-response metric category.\n- Retried attempts must be measured independently while retaining the\nlogical operation identity.\n- Sensitive response content must never appear in warning-level\ndiagnostics.\n- Response content may be emitted only when `log_response_body` is\nexplicitly enabled.\n- All client and metric state must remain local to one pipeline\ninstance.\n- The implementation must not introduce shared cross-core\nsynchronization or unbounded queues.\n- Rust source must remain ASCII-only.\n- Every test must include the required `Scenario` and `Guarantees`\ndocumentation.\n\n## Explicit Exclusions from This PR\n\nThese capabilities remain deferred so Phase 3 stays focused on the\nstandalone transport and telemetry contracts:\n\n- Wiring the client into the exporter runtime\n- Constructing or managing the runtime HTTP client pool\n- Enforcing `max_in_flight` through runtime scheduling\n- Azure Identity token acquisition\n- Token refresh and replacement-token handling\n- Retaining HTTP 401 requests while awaiting a replacement token\n- Gzip compression of transformed payloads\n- Cross-message batching and request coalescing\n- Runtime backpressure and retained-message ownership\n- Pipeline ACK/NACK behavior\n- Recording logical batch metrics from the exporter loop\n- Periodic runtime metric reporting\n- Shutdown draining and pending-request cancellation\n- ADX queued ingestion\n- Provisioning ADX databases, tables, or mappings\n- Activating the exporter for production use\n\n## Related Issue\n\nThis is Phase 3 of #4159.\n\nIt builds on:\n\n- #4311 — component skeleton, configuration, and design\n- #4382 — bounded logs, metrics, and traces transformation\n\nLater phases will connect transformation, compression, authentication,\ntransport, batching, telemetry reporting, and pipeline completion\nhandling into the operational exporter runtime.\n\n## Validation\n\nThe following validation completed successfully:\n\n- `cargo fmt --all` - passed\n- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` - passed\n- `cargo build -p otel-arrow-dfe --bin df_engine --features\nazure-data-explorer` - passed\n- `cargo test -p otel-arrow-dfe-contrib-nodes --features\nazure-data-explorer azure_data_explorer_exporter` - passed\n- `cargo xtask check` - passed, including workspace structure, component\ninventory, formatting, Clippy, unit tests, integration tests, and\ndoctests\n- `npx markdownlint-cli2\nrust/otap-dataflow/crates/contrib-nodes/src/exporters/azure_data_explorer_exporter/README.md`\n- passed\n- `git diff --check` - passed\n\n## User-Facing Changes\n\nNone. The exporter remains non-operational and continues to return its\nexplicit not-implemented error.\n\nNo changelog entry is required because this is an internal\nimplementation phase and the PR title includes `chore`.\n\n## Additional Context\n\nPhase 1 established the exporter component, configuration model,\nschemas, and complete intended design.\n\nPhase 2 added bounded transformation of logs, metrics, and traces into\nADX-compatible JSON rows.\n\nPhase 3 adds the standalone managed-streaming transport client, retry\nand timeout behavior, bounded response diagnostics, error\nclassification, and exporter telemetry contracts while deliberately\nleaving runtime integration disabled.\n\nRelevant design documentation:\n\n[Azure Data Explorer exporter\ndesign](https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/main/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/contrib-nodes/src/exporters/azure_data_explorer_exporter/design.md)",

Do not compare errors with `==` or by\ntheir text.\n- When you append an encoded sketch to a larger buffer, frame it.\n\n##### Behavior changes\n\n- `UnmarshalBinary`, `MarshalBinary`, `AppendBinary`, and `Merge` wrap\nthe errors that they return. `err == ErrorTooShort` is always false.\n- `Merge` wraps `ErrorPrecisionMismatch` when the precisions differ. The\nerror message includes both precisions.\n- `UnmarshalBinary` rejects trailing bytes with `ErrorInvalidData`. It\nalso rejects unknown versions, invalid precisions, out-of-range\nregisters, and malformed sparse lists.\n- If `UnmarshalBinary` returns an error, the receiver does not change.\nThe sketch that it decodes does not share memory with the input buffer.\n- `Insert` and `InsertHash` on a zero-value `Sketch` give it precision\n14 and the sparse representation, the same as `New`. In v0.2.6, they\npanicked.\n- `Merge` into a zero-value `Sketch` copies the other sketch, and\n`Estimate` on a zero-value `Sketch` returns 0. In v0.2.6, both panicked.\n- `Merge` with a zero-value argument does nothing. In v0.2.6, it\nreturned an error.\n- `MarshalBinary` and `AppendBinary` on a zero-value `Sketch` return an\nerror that wraps `ErrorInvalidPrecision`. In v0.2.6, they returned an\n8-byte header with precision 0.\n- `Estimate` converts a sparse sketch to dense when its sparse list\ngrows past the register count. In v0.2.6, calls to `Estimate` between\nsmall batches of inserts let the sparse list grow without limit.\n- A sketch that v0.2.6 saved with such an oversized sparse list can give\na different estimate after v0.3.0 decodes it. In tests, the difference\nwas 1.1% or less.\n\n##### Additions\n\n- `Sketch.Reset` clears a sketch and keeps its representation and\nallocated storage.\n- `ErrorInvalidVersion`, `ErrorInvalidPrecision`, `ErrorInvalidData`,\nand `ErrorPrecisionMismatch` are sentinel errors to match with\n`errors.Is`.\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n- fix ut logic error in TestHLL_Merge_Complex. by\n[@&#8203;CodeZHXS](https://redirect.github.com/CodeZHXS) in\n[#&#8203;59](https://redirect.github.com/axiomhq/hyperloglog/pull/59)\n- Add runnable examples to replace demo directory by\n[@&#8203;lukasmalkmus](https://redirect.github.com/lukasmalkmus) in\n[#&#8203;56](https://redirect.github.com/axiomhq/hyperloglog/pull/56)\n- allow compiler to inline hash function by\n[@&#8203;mgartner](https://redirect.github.com/mgartner) in\n[#&#8203;64](https://redirect.github.com/axiomhq/hyperloglog/pull/64)\n- Feature: Adding support for Reset by\n[@&#8203;MovieStoreGuy](https://redirect.github.com/MovieStoreGuy) in\n[#&#8203;62](https://redirect.github.com/axiomhq/hyperloglog/pull/62)\n- Harden UnmarshalBinary validation by\n[@&#8203;seiflotfy](https://redirect.github.com/seiflotfy) in\n[#&#8203;65](https://redirect.github.com/axiomhq/hyperloglog/pull/65)\n- Harden sketch API and decoding by\n[@&#8203;seiflotfy](https://redirect.github.com/seiflotfy) in\n[#&#8203;66](https://redirect.github.com/axiomhq/hyperloglog/pull/66)\n- docs: fix project name reference, spelling, and period in\nContributing.md by\n[@&#8203;amir-rezaei](https://redirect.github.com/amir-rezaei) in\n[#&#8203;67](https://redirect.github.com/axiomhq/hyperloglog/pull/67)\n- Add CI and release automation by\n[@&#8203;seiflotfy](https://redirect.github.com/seiflotfy) in\n[#&#8203;68](https://redirect.github.com/axiomhq/hyperloglog/pull/68)\n- Fix unbounded sparse growth, a uint32 underflow in Estimate, and\nbenchmark measurement by\n[@&#8203;seiflotfy](https://redirect.github.com/seiflotfy) in\n[#&#8203;69](https://redirect.github.com/axiomhq/hyperloglog/pull/69)\n- docs: fix H1 heading level and fork clone URL placeholder in\nContributing.md by\n[@&#8203;amir-rezaei](https://redirect.github.com/amir-rezaei) in\n[#&#8203;70](https://redirect.github.com/axiomhq/hyperloglog/pull/70)\n- docs: fix verb parallelism, missing trailing period, and article in\nREADME.md by\n[@&#8203;amir-rezaei](https://redirect.github.com/amir-rezaei) in\n[#&#8203;71](https://redirect.github.com/axiomhq/hyperloglog/pull/71)\n- .github/workflows: publish releases with goreleaser by\n[@&#8203;lukasmalkmus](https://redirect.github.com/lukasmalkmus) in\n[#&#8203;74](https://redirect.github.com/axiomhq/hyperloglog/pull/74)\n\n#### New Contributors\n\n- [@&#8203;CodeZHXS](https://redirect.github.com/CodeZHXS) made their\nfirst contribution in\n[#&#8203;59](https://redirect.github.com/axiomhq/hyperloglog/pull/59)\n- [@&#8203;lukasmalkmus](https://redirect.github.com/lukasmalkmus) made\ntheir first contribution in\n[#&#8203;56](https://redirect.github.com/axiomhq/hyperloglog/pull/56)\n- [@&#8203;MovieStoreGuy](https://redirect.github.com/MovieStoreGuy)\nmade their first contribution in\n[#&#8203;62](https://redirect.github.com/axiomhq/hyperloglog/pull/62)\n- [@&#8203;amir-rezaei](https://redirect.github.com/amir-rezaei) made\ntheir first contribution in\n[#&#8203;67](https://redirect.github.com/axiomhq/hyperloglog/pull/67)\n\n**Full Changelog**:\n<https://github.com/axiomhq/hyperloglog/compare/v0.2.6...v0.3.0>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: (UTC)\n\n- Branch creation\n  - \"before 8am on Friday\"\n- Automerge\n  - At any time (no schedule defined)\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
