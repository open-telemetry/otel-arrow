This now reindexes all the required columns, has support for\nmetrics, and has support for dictionary encoded columns.\n\nI also was able to uncomment most of the batching tests after this\nchange 🥳. One more to go which requires split.\n\nOther minor changes:\n\n- Made it so that `allowed_payload_types` returns payload types in the\nexact same order that they are stored. This is occasionally handy to\nhave.\n\nThings deferred:\n\n- Benchmarks. I had nothing to compare it to since the original didn't\nreindex a bunch of the necessary columns anyway like scope or resource\nid nor did it support dictionaries. I'll add these in when I get to the\nnext point..\n- Some optimization opportunities like using naive offsets instead of\nsorting and reindexing everything starting at 0. We need this path\nbecause it's possible to get into situations where we absolutely need to\ncompact things down to fit into u16, but we can likely skip it a decent\nportion of the time.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\nPart of #1926.\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nI added a big unit test suite.\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: albertlockett <a.lockett@f5.com>",

          "message": "Columnar query engine expression evaluation: simple arithmetic (#2126)\n\n# Change Summary\n\n<!--\nReplace with a brief summary of the change in this PR\n-->\n\nAdds a module to the columnar query engine with the ability evaluate\nsimple arithmetic expressions on OTAP record batches. For example, it\ncould evaluate expressions such as `severity_number + attributes[\"x\"] *\n2`.\n\nNote that the expression evaluation isn't yet integrated into any\n`PipelineStage` implementation, but the intention is that this can soon\nbe used to implement more advanced filtering, attribute insertion,\ncolumn updates and so on.\n\nWhile on the surface, this isolated simple arithmetic not appear\nterribly useful, the main/important contributions in this PR are to lay\ndown some foundations for future expression evaluation:\n\n**Transparent joins in the expression tree**\nThis PR adds is the ability to evaluate a set of DataFusion expressions\nwhile transparently joining data from different record batches as the\nexpression evaluates.\n\nFor example, consider we had `severity_number * 2 + attributes[\"x\"] +\nattributes[\"y\"]`, we'd need to first evaluate:\n- 1. `severity_number * 2`\n- 2. `attributes where key = \"x\"`, then select the value column based on\nthe type\n- 3. `attributes where key = \"y\"`, then select the value column based on\nthe type,\n\nThen we need to join these three expressions on the ID/parent ID\nrelationship, then perform the additions.\n\nThis PR builds the expression tree in such a way that it can manage\nwhere these joins need to happen on either side of a binary expression,\nand it performs the joins automatically during expression evaluation\nwhile keeping track of the ID scope/row order of the current data at\neach stage.\n\n**Type evaluation and coercion**\n\nWhile planning the expression, the planner attempts to keep track of\nwhat are the possible types that the expression could produce if it were\nto successfully evaluate. When it detects invalid types, it is able to\nproduce an error indicating an invalid expression.\n\nFor example, we'd be able to detect at planning time that `severity_text\n+ 2` is invalid, because text can't be added to a number.\n\nFor expressions where we can't determine that the types are invalid at\nplanning time, it will be determined and runtime and an error will be\nproduced when the expression evaluates on some batch. For example\n`attributes[\"x\"] + 2`, it's unknown whether `attributes[\"x\"]` is an\nint64, so it's assumed that the expression will produce an int64, and if\n`attributes[\"x\"]` is found not to be this type, an ExecutionError will\nbe produced.\n\nThe planner automatically coerces integer types when necessary.\nCurrently when adding two integers, they will be coerced into the\nlargest type that could contain the value, while keeping the signed-ness\nof one side. For example, uint8 + int32 will produce an int32. I realize\nthis type of automatic integer coercion is probably controversial, so in\nthe future I'm happy to get rid of this in favour of forcing explicit\ncasting if that is preferred.\n\n**Missing data / null propagation**\n\nWhen one side of an expression is null, for the purposes of arithmetic\nthe expression will evaluate to null. This includes the case of null\nvalues, missing attributes, missing columns, and missing optional record\nbatches.\n\nFor example: `attributes[\"x\"] + 2` would evaluate as null if the\nattribtues record batch was not present, there were no attributes with\n`key == \"x\"`, or the attributes where `key==\"x\"` had type empty, and so\non.\n\n**Relocated the projection code**\n\nAdds a new module called `pipeline::project` which has the projection\ncode that was previously inside the filter module. We need to project\nthe input record batches into a known schema to evaluate the\nexpressions, and also consider the expression evaluation to result in a\n`null` if the projection could evaluate due to missing data.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n<!--\nWe highly recommend correlation of every PR to an issue\n-->\n\n* Relates to https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/issues/2058\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nThere are 64 new unit tests covering these changes\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\n <!-- If yes, provide further info below -->\n\nNo\n\n\n## Future work/followups:\nThere are many, but most pressing are:\n- Other types of expression evaluation, including string expressions,\nunary math expressions, function invocation and bridging this with the\nfiltering code (for expressions that produce boolean arrays).\n- Integrating expression evaluation with various pipeline stages\nincluding those which set attributes, set values, and filtering\n- OPL Parser support for the type of expressions we're able to evaluate\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Laurent Quérel <laurent.querel@gmail.com>\nCo-authored-by: Laurent Quérel <l.querel@f5.com>",

          "message": "feat: handle Ack and Nack messages in OTAP Exporter. (#1994)\n\n# Change Summary\n\nPart of #1325 (see also #1324).\n\n## Problem: flaky test due to sleep-based synchronization.\n\nThe OTAP Exporter had two related issues:\n\n### 1. Dropped Context\n\nWhen the exporter received pipeline data (OtapPdata), it split the\nmessage into context and payload, then threw away the context:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/82f71508f8e598e78853335cce82195e894894cd/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/otap/src/otap_exporter.rs#L233-L235\n\nThe context carries routing information that tells the pipeline who to\nnotify when a message succeeds or fails. Without it, the exporter was a\nblack hole — data went in, but no confirmation ever came back.\n\n### 2. Flaky Test\n\nThe test `test_receiver_not_ready_on_start` had no way to know when the\nexporter finished processing, so it used arbitrary sleeps:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/82f71508f8e598e78853335cce82195e894894cd/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/otap/src/otap_exporter.rs#L866-L868\n\n\nhttps://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/82f71508f8e598e78853335cce82195e894894cd/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/otap/src/otap_exporter.rs#L870-L872\n\n\nhttps://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/82f71508f8e598e78853335cce82195e894894cd/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/otap/src/otap_exporter.rs#L883-L885\n\nOn a slow machine or under load, these might not be long enough. On a\nfast machine, they waste time.\n\n## Solution: thread context through for ACK/NACK.\n\nThe core idea is to preserve the `OtapPdata` context by using\n`take_payload()` instead of `into_parts()`.\n\nThis extracts the payload for gRPC transmission while keeping the\ncontext alive in the original OtapPdata. Then pass that context through\nthe entire streaming pipeline so it can be returned with ACK (success)\nor NACK (failure) notifications.\n\n## Key changes\n\n1. Preserve context at the entry point\n\n```rust\n  // Before: context discarded\n  let (_context, payload) = pdata.into_parts();\n\n  // After: payload extracted, context preserved\n  let payload = pdata.take_payload();\n```\n\n2. Pair each batch with its context through the pipeline\n\nThe internal channels changed from carrying just data to carrying\n(context, data) tuples:\n\n```rust\n  // Before\n  channel::<OtapArrowRecords>(64)\n\n  // After\n  channel::<(OtapPdata, OtapArrowRecords)>(64)\n```\n\n3. Correlate gRPC responses with their original requests\n\nThe exporter uses bidirectional gRPC streaming — requests go out on one\nstream, responses come back on another. A FIFO correlation channel pairs\nthem:\n\n```\n  create_req_stream ──sends pdata──→ [correlation channel] ──recv pdata──→ handle_res_stream\n    (yielded batch)                                                         (got response)\n```\n\nSince both streams are ordered, the first response always corresponds to\nthe first request.\n\n\n4. Send ACK/NACK in the main loop\n\n```rust\n  Some(PDataMetricsUpdate::Exported(signal_type, pdata)) => {\n      self.pdata_metrics.inc_exported(signal_type);\n      effect_handler.notify_ack(AckMsg::new(pdata)).await?;\n  },\n  Some(PDataMetricsUpdate::Failed(signal_type, pdata)) => {\n      self.pdata_metrics.inc_failed(signal_type);\n      effect_handler.notify_nack(NackMsg::new(\"export failed\", pdata)).await?;\n  },\n```\n\nThe effect_handler uses the context inside pdata to route ACK/NACK back\nthrough the pipeline.\n\n\n5. Replace sleeps with deterministic waits in the test\n\n```Rust\n  // Before: sleep and hope\n  tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(5)).await;\n\n  // After: wait for the actual event\n  timeout(Duration::from_secs(5), async {\n      loop {\n          match pipeline_ctrl_msg_rx.recv().await {\n              Ok(PipelineControlMsg::DeliverNack { .. }) => break,\n              Ok(_) => continue,\n              Err(_) => panic!(\"pipeline ctrl channel closed\"),\n          }\n      }\n  }).await.expect(\"Timed out waiting for NACK\");\n```\n\nThe test is now event-driven: it proceeds as soon as the NACK/ACK\narrives, with a 5-second timeout as a safety net.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/issues/1611\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\n <!-- If yes, provide further info below -->\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Drew Relmas <drewrelmas@gmail.com>",

Before this\nchange, we were simply using arrow's `concat_batches` helper function\nwith expects all the `RecordBatch`s to have the same schema. However,\nthis would cause a problem if some branch of the statement changes the\nschema.\n\nThis PR corrects the issue by using OTAP's\n[`concatenate`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/eaa4103326057ef68125244171801bc010cb3571/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/pdata/src/otap/transform/concatenate.rs#L75)\nfunction instead which correctly expands each `RecordBatch` into a\ncommon schema.\n\nThere's one pipeline stage that also writes new IDs to the rows with\nnull IDs (this happens when we assign attributes). In order for\n`concatenate` to produce a valid batch, we need to ensure the IDs are\nglobally unique. This PR adds a mechanism to initialize shared state for\ndifferent implementations of the same pipeline stage if they're being\nused in a nested branch within conditional pipeline stage, and uses it\nfor the purpose of ensuring unique IDs when filling in these null rows.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n<!--\nWe highly recommend correlation of every PR to an issue\n-->\n\n* Closes #2216 \n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nUnit tests\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo\n\n <!-- If yes, provide further info below -->",

          "message": "Add data sanitization step for transform processor results (#2434)\n\n# Change Summary\n\n<!--\nReplace with a brief summary of the change in this PR\n-->\n\nAdds a \"sanitization\" step which can be performed on the result produced\nby the transform processor. This passes over all the the columns in all\nthe RecordBatch's and removes any values from dictionary columns that\nhave no keys pointing to them.\n\nThe procedure has some performance overhead, so there is an option to\nskip if if, for example the transformation isn't removing sensitive\ndata, or if something further along in the pipeline would remove the\nhidden arrow data (for example, serializing to OTLP in the OTLP\nexporter).\n\n**Why is this necessary?**\nSome of the arrow compute kernels will perform transformations ignoring\ncertain buffers for best performance if the result would still be a\nsemantically correct arrow array. For example when filtering, the arrow\ncompute kernels only filter dictionary key columns without touching the\ndictionaries.\n\nI'm imagining that someday someone will try to use transform processor\nto try to redact sensitive data, but the values from the rows they\ndeleted will still be present in the arrow buffers. If they then\ntransmitted the data using OTAP exporter (which does a simple arrow IPC\nserialization), the \"redacted\" data has escaped.\n\n**Why blindly do this for all transforms on all columns? Can't the\nquery-engine be smarter about this?**\nMaybe - but it's not as simple as it appears.\n\nFor example, consider when we're filtering. If we did something like:\n`logs | where event_name != \"sensitive_event_name\"`, it might be easy to\nthink that `event_name` is the sensitive column so it's the only one\nthat needs sanitizing. But _maybe_ the user actually knows a-priori that\nany log w/ this event name actually has sensitive data in some other\ncolumn.\n\nWhen it comes to the security of, I feel that it's better to be err on\nthe side of caution.\n\nIn the future we could maybe consider a better system where we let the\nuser provide hints about what fields they consider sensitive.\n\n**What's the performance impact?**\n\nThis sanitizing step adds significant overhead. When adding this\nsanitization step into the query engine's benchmarks, I saw anywhere\nbetween 5%-45% performance overhead on top of just executing the\ntransform pipeline w/ no sanitization. The actual overhead depends on\nthe complexity of the transform and size of output.\n\nThis poor performance is another reason why there's an option to skip\nthis step.\n\n**Should sanitize be on by default?**\n\nMy feeling is yes. If someone forgets to configure this or misconfigures\nit, I feel that it's best to fail on the side of worse\nperformance/better security.\n\n**Does this have to happen in the transform processor?**\n\nI feel that this is a reasonable place to do this, but open to\nsuggestions if anyone feels differently.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n<!--\nWe highly recommend correlation of every PR to an issue\n-->\n\n* Closes #2313\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nUnit tests\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nThere's a new user facing config field called `skip_sanitize_result`\n\n <!-- If yes, provide further info below -->\n\nCo-authored-by: Laurent Quérel <l.querel@f5.com>",

          "message": "feat(config): add optional field to EngineConfig (#2727)\n\nAllow applications embedding the dataflow engine to carry their own\nengine-level configuration under `engine.custom`. The engine ignores\nthis field entirely; embedding binaries can read namespaced keys for\nconcerns like remote management, auth, or fleet coordination.\n\n# Change Summary\n\nAdd an optional `custom: HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>` field to\n`EngineConfig`. This gives embedding applications an escape hatch for\nengine-level config without forking the config crate or pre-parsing\nYAML. The field defaults to an empty map and is omitted from serialized\noutput when empty.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* Closes #2561\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nThree new unit tests in `engine.rs`:\n- `from_yaml_accepts_custom_config` — parses a config with multiple\nnamespaced custom keys and verifies values\n- `custom_defaults_to_empty` — confirms the field defaults to an empty\nmap when omitted\n- `custom_roundtrips_through_json` — serializes to JSON and deserializes\nback, verifying data is preserved\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nYes. A new optional `custom` key is available under the `engine` section\nof the YAML/JSON config. Example:\n\n```yaml\nengine:\n  custom:\n    remote_management:\n      server_url: \"ws://mgmt.example.com/v1\"\n      heartbeat_interval_secs: 10\n    custom_auth:\n      provider: \"oidc\"\n      token_endpoint: \"https://auth.example.com/token\"\n```\n\nExisting configs are unaffected since the field defaults to empty.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Lalit Kumar Bhasin <lalit_fin@yahoo.com>",

The dual variants are\n  derived from one source, so authors can't accidentally let local\n  and shared semantics diverge.\n- New `pipeline_factory.rs` expansion to build the static\n  `PipelineFactory` registry used by `main.rs`.\n- All emitted paths use fully-qualified `::std::...` /\n  `::async_trait::...` / `::otap_df_engine::...` so generated code is\n  hygienic in any caller crate.\n\n### Capability registry (`engine::capability`)\n\n- `CapabilityRegistry`: typed-keyed (`(extension_name, TypeId)`)\n  storage with **typestate-enforced** single `.shared()` / `.local()`\n  registration per builder — duplicates are unrepresentable rather\n  than runtime errors.\n- Two execution models: native local (`Rc<dyn Local>`, lock-free) and\n  native shared (`Box<dyn Shared>`, `Send + Clone`). A shared-only\n  extension serves local consumers transparently via the\n  `SharedAsLocal` adapter generated by the proc macro.\n- Two **instance policies** chosen at build time, invisible to\n  consumers: `.cloned()` (clone a stored prototype) and\n  `.constructed()` (per-consumer construction via a closure;\n  Passive-only — `Active + Constructed` is statically rejected).\n- `resolve_bindings`: walks a node's `capabilities:` declaration and\n  produces a per-node `Capabilities` bundle with all bindings\n  resolved, surfacing config errors (unknown extension, unknown\n  capability, capability not provided by bound extension, multiple\n  bindings for the same capability).\n- `Capabilities`: per-node consumer API with `require_local`,\n  `require_shared`, `optional_local`, `optional_shared`. Instances\n  are minted lazily at the call site, not at resolution time.\n- `ConsumedTracker`: cross-node, per-(capability, extension)\n  consumption flags driving `drop_local()` / `drop_shared()` cleanup\n  for extensions no node ever claimed.\n\n### One-shot consumption contract\n\nA binding is claimable **at most once per node**, regardless of\nexecution model. The guard is the `Cell<Option<_>>::take()` on each\nresolved entry's `produce` closure — no auxiliary flag.\n\n- Same accessor twice → `CapabilityAlreadyConsumed`.\n- Different accessors on a SharedAsLocal-fallback binding share one\n  underlying entry, so claiming either side consumes the other\n  naturally.\n- Different accessors on a native-dual binding (extension registered\n  both native local **and** native shared) take and drop the\n  alternative entry's `produce` closure on success, so the\n  per-binding contract holds uniformly. The cross-node tracker is\n  only flipped by actual consumption, not by invalidation, so\n  `drop_*` cleanup remains correct.\n\n### Documentation\n\n- `docs/extension-system-architecture.md`: rewritten to describe the\n  capability-based design, the local/shared duality, instance\n  policies, Active vs Passive lifecycle, and the typestate builder.\n\n## Tests\n\nNew, focused unit tests cover:\n\n- Registry: typestate single-registration, duplicate rejection,\n  `SharedAsLocal` adapter freshness per node, double-`Box` envelope\n  for shared `produce`.\n- `resolve_bindings`: every error path (unknown extension / unknown\n  capability / capability not provided / wrong extension), local-only\n  and shared-only binding shapes, fallback path, native-dual path.\n- One-shot contract: second-call rejection on each of `require_local`,\n  `require_shared`, `optional_local`, `optional_shared`; fallback\n  cross-side rejection; native-dual cross-side rejection (both\n  directions).\n- `ConsumedTracker`: per-extension consumption flags, with the\n  invariant that mere invalidation does not flip a bucket.\n- Proc-macro end-to-end: `local-only`, `shared-only`, and `dual`\n  forms of `extension_capabilities!` against the registry.\n\n## Validation\n\n```text\ncargo xtask check\n✅ Cargo workspace structure complies with project policies.\n✅ Formatting completed successfully.\n✅ Clippy linting passed without warnings.\n✅ All tests passed successfully.\n```\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>",

          "message": "Fix duplicate attribute keys in transform_attributes (#2423)\n\n# Fix Duplicate Attribute Keys in `transform_attributes`\n\n## Changes Made\nThis PR resolves issue #1650 by ensuring that dictionary keys are\ndeduplicated when transformations such as `rename` are applied, as\nrequired by the OpenTelemetry specification (\"Exported maps MUST contain\nonly unique keys by default\").\n\nTo accomplish this while maintaining strict performance requirements, we\nreplaced the previous `RowConverter` deduplication strategy with a new\nhigh-performance, proactive pre-filter:\n- We injected `filter_rename_collisions` into\n`transform_attributes_impl` inside\n`otap-dataflow/crates/pdata/src/otap/transform.rs`.\n- Before a rename is processed, this function reads the `parent_id`s and\ntarget keys. It uses the `IdBitmap` type to find any existing target\nkeys whose `parent_id` maps back to an old key that will be renamed.\n- It proactively strips those collision rows from the batch via\n`arrow::compute::filter_record_batch` *before* the actual transform\nhappens.\n\n## Testing\n- Extended the `AttributesProcessor` unit tests\n(`test_rename_removes_duplicate_keys`) to explicitly verify that\nrenaming an attribute resulting in a collision automatically discards\nduplicate keys.\n- Extended the `AttributesTransformPipelineStage` in `query-engine`\ntests with a parallel case ensuring OPL/KQL query pipelines\n(`project-rename`) properly drop duplicates when resolving duplicates.\n- Refactored `otap_df_pdata` `transform.rs` tests to properly expect\ndeduplicated keys using this plan-based method.\n- Validated logic with `cargo test --workspace --all-features`.\n\n## Validation Results\nAll tests pass. OTel semantic rules surrounding unique mapped keys map\ncleanly through down/upstream processors. The `IdBitmap` intersection\napproach completely resolves the multi-thousand percent `RowConverter`\nperformance regressions, dropping collision resolution overhead to\nessentially zero through efficient bitmap operations.\n\n---------\n\nSigned-off-by: Gyanranjan Panda <gyanranjanpanda438@gmail.com>\nCo-authored-by: Gyan Ranjan Panda <gyanranjanpanda@users.noreply.github.com>\nCo-authored-by: albertlockett <a.lockett@f5.com>",

*Upcoming breaking change*: Add a deprecation warning for customers\nusing CodeQL version 2.19.3 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were\ndiscontinued on 9 April 2026 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.15,\nand will be unsupported by the next minor release of the CodeQL Action.\n[#&#8203;3837](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3837)\n- Configurations for private registries that use Cloudsmith or GCP OIDC\nare now accepted.\n[#&#8203;3850](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3850)\n- Best-effort connection tests for private registries now use `GET`\nrequests instead of `HEAD` for better compatibility with various\nregistry implementations. For NuGet feeds, the test is now always\nperformed against the service index.\n[#&#8203;3853](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3853)\n- Fixed a bug where two diagnostics produced within the same millisecond\ncould overwrite each other on disk, causing one of them to be lost.\n[#&#8203;3852](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3852)\n- Update default CodeQL bundle version to\n[2.25.3](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/tag/codeql-bundle-v2.25.3).\n[#&#8203;3865](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3865)\n\n###\n[`v4.35.2`](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/tag/v4.35.2)\n\n[Compare\nSource](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/compare/v4.35.1...v4.35.2)\n\n- The undocumented TRAP cache cleanup feature that could be enabled\nusing the `CODEQL_ACTION_CLEANUP_TRAP_CACHES` environment variable is\ndeprecated and will be removed in May 2026. If you are affected by this,\nwe recommend disabling TRAP caching by passing the `trap-caching: false`\ninput to the `init` Action.\n[#&#8203;3795](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3795)\n- The Git version 2.36.0 requirement for improved incremental analysis\nnow only applies to repositories that contain submodules.\n[#&#8203;3789](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3789)\n- Python analysis on GHES no longer extracts the standard library,\nrelying instead on models of the standard library. This should result in\nsignificantly faster extraction and analysis times, while the effect on\nalerts should be minimal.\n[#&#8203;3794](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3794)\n- Fixed a bug in the validation of OIDC configurations for private\nregistries that was added in CodeQL Action 4.33.0 / 3.33.0.\n[#&#8203;3807](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3807)\n- Update default CodeQL bundle version to\n[2.25.2](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/tag/codeql-bundle-v2.25.2).\n[#&#8203;3823](https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/3823)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>actions/go-versions (go)</summary>\n\n###\n[`v1.26.2`](https://redirect.github.com/actions/go-versions/releases/tag/1.26.2-24114135105):\n1.26.2\n\n[Compare\nSource](https://redirect.github.com/actions/go-versions/compare/1.26.1-22746851271...1.26.2-24114135105)\n\nGo 1.26.2\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>step-security/harden-runner\n(step-security/harden-runner)</summary>\n\n###\n[`v2.19.0`](https://redirect.github.com/step-security/harden-runner/releases/tag/v2.19.0)\n\n[Compare\nSource](https://redirect.github.com/step-security/harden-runner/compare/v2.18.0...v2.19.0)\n\n##### What's Changed\n\n##### New Runner Support\n\nHarden-Runner now supports Depot, Blacksmith, Namespace, and WarpBuild\nrunners with the same egress monitoring, runtime monitoring, and policy\nenforcement available on GitHub-hosted runners.\n\n##### Automated Incident Response for Supply Chain Attacks\n\n- Global block list: Outbound connections to known malicious domains and\nIPs are now blocked even in audit mode.\n- System-defined detection rules: Harden-Runner will trigger lockdown\nmode when a high risk event is detected during an active supply chain\nattack (for example, a process reading the memory of the runner worker\nprocess, a common technique for stealing GitHub Actions secrets).\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\nWindows and macOS: stability and reliability fixes\n\n**Full Changelog**:\n<https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/compare/v2.18.0...v2.19.0>\n\n###\n[`v2.18.0`](https://redirect.github.com/step-security/harden-runner/releases/tag/v2.18.0)\n\n[Compare\nSource](https://redirect.github.com/step-security/harden-runner/compare/v2.17.0...v2.18.0)\n\n##### What's Changed\n\nGlobal Block List: During supply chain incidents like the recent axios\nand trivy compromises, StepSecurity will add known malicious domains and\nIP addresses (IOCs) to a global block list. These will be automatically\nblocked, even in audit mode, providing immediate protection without\nrequiring any workflow changes.\n\nDeploy on Self-Hosted VM: Added `deploy-on-self-hosted-vm` input that\nallows the Harden Runner agent to be installed directly on ephemeral\nself-hosted Linux runner VMs at workflow runtime. This is intended as an\nalternative when baking the agent into the VM image is not possible.\n\n**Full Changelog**:\n<https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/compare/v2.17.0...v2.18.0>\n\n###\n[`v2.17.0`](https://redirect.github.com/step-security/harden-runner/releases/tag/v2.17.0)\n\n[Compare\nSource](https://redirect.github.com/step-security/harden-runner/compare/v2.16.1...v2.17.0)\n\n##### What's Changed\n\n##### Policy Store Support\n\nAdded `use-policy-store` and `api-key` inputs to fetch security policies\ndirectly from the [StepSecurity Policy\nStore](https://docs.stepsecurity.io/harden-runner/policy-store).\nPolicies can be defined and attached at the workflow, repo, org, or\ncluster (ARC) level, with the most granular policy taking precedence.\nThis is the preferred method over the existing `policy` input which\nrequires `id-token: write` permission. If no policy is found in the\nstore, the action defaults to audit mode.\n\n**Full

Notably `krates` was updated to resolve two issues with\ncrates being pruned from the graph used when running checks. Resolving\nthese two issues may mean that updating cargo-deny may highlight issues\nthat were previously hidden.\n-\n[EmbarkStudios/krates#106](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/krates/issues/106)\nwould fail to pull in crates brought in via a feature if that crate had\nits `lib` target renamed by the package author.\n-\n[EmbarkStudios/krates#109](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/krates/issues/109)\nwould fail to bring in optional dependencies if they were brought in by\na weak feature in a crate *also* brought in by a weak feature.\n\n##### Changed\n\n-\n[PR#830](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/830)\nremoved `gix` in favor of shelling out to `git`. This massively improves\nbuild times and eases maintenance as `gix` bumps minor versions quite\nfrequently. If cargo-deny is used in an environment that for some reason\nallows internet access but doesn't have `git` available, the advisory\ndatabase would need to be updated before calling cargo-deny.\n-\n[PR#838](https://redirect.github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/pull/838)\nremoved `rustsec` in favor of manually implemented advisory parsing and\nchecking, with a nightly cron job that checks that the implementation\nexactly matches rustsec on the official rustsec advisory db.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Swatinem/rust-cache

These will be automatically\nblocked, even in audit mode, providing immediate protection without\nrequiring any workflow changes.\n\nDeploy on Self-Hosted VM: Added `deploy-on-self-hosted-vm` input that\nallows the Harden Runner agent to be installed directly on ephemeral\nself-hosted Linux runner VMs at workflow runtime. This is intended as an\nalternative when baking the agent into the VM image is not possible.\n\n**Full Changelog**:\n<https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/compare/v2.17.0...v2.18.0>\n\n###\n[`v2.17.0`](https://redirect.github.com/step-security/harden-runner/releases/tag/v2.17.0)\n\n[Compare\nSource](https://redirect.github.com/step-security/harden-runner/compare/v2.16.1...v2.17.0)\n\n##### What's Changed\n\n##### Policy Store Support\n\nAdded `use-policy-store` and `api-key` inputs to fetch security policies\ndirectly from the [StepSecurity Policy\nStore](https://docs.stepsecurity.io/harden-runner/policy-store).\nPolicies can be defined and attached at the workflow, repo, org, or\ncluster (ARC) level, with the most granular policy taking precedence.\nThis is the preferred method over the existing `policy` input which\nrequires `id-token: write` permission. If no policy is found in the\nstore, the action defaults to audit mode.\n\n**Full

Create additional authenticated Octokit clients with different\ntokens for multi-token workflows, GitHub App tokens, and cross-org\naccess. See [Creating additional clients with\n`getOctokit`](https://redirect.github.com/actions/github-script#creating-additional-clients-with-getoctokit)\nfor details and examples.\n- **Orchestration ID in user-agent** — The `ACTIONS_ORCHESTRATION_ID`\nenvironment variable is automatically appended to the user-agent string\nfor request tracing.\n\n**Breaking changes:**\n\n- **`require('@&#8203;actions/github')` no longer works in scripts.**\nThe upgrade to `@actions/github` v9 (ESM-only) means\n`require('@&#8203;actions/github')` will fail at runtime. If you\npreviously used patterns like `const { getOctokit } =\nrequire('@&#8203;actions/github')` to create secondary clients, use the\nnew injected `getOctokit` function instead — it's available directly in\nthe script context with no imports needed.\n- `getOctokit` is now an injected function parameter. Scripts that\ndeclare `const getOctokit = ...` or `let getOctokit = ...` will get a\n`SyntaxError` because JavaScript does not allow `const`/`let`\nredeclaration of function parameters. Use the injected `getOctokit`\ndirectly, or use `var getOctokit = ...` if you need to redeclare it.\n- If your script accesses other `@actions/github` internals beyond the\nstandard `github`/`octokit` client, you may need to update those\nreferences for v9 compatibility.\n\n##### What's Changed\n\n- Add ACTIONS\\_ORCHESTRATION\\_ID to user-agent string by\n[@&#8203;Copilot](https://redirect.github.com/Copilot) in\n[#&#8203;695](https://redirect.github.com/actions/github-script/pull/695)\n- ci: use deployment: false for integration test environments by\n[@&#8203;salmanmkc](https://redirect.github.com/salmanmkc) in\n[#&#8203;712](https://redirect.github.com/actions/github-script/pull/712)\n- feat!: add getOctokit to script context, upgrade\n[@&#8203;actions/github](https://redirect.github.com/actions/github) v9,\n[@&#8203;octokit/core](https://redirect.github.com/octokit/core) v7, and\nrelated packages by\n[@&#8203;salmanmkc](https://redirect.github.com/salmanmkc) in\n[#&#8203;700](https://redirect.github.com/actions/github-script/pull/700)\n\n##### New Contributors\n\n- [@&#8203;Copilot](https://redirect.github.com/Copilot) made their\nfirst contribution in\n[#&#8203;695](https://redirect.github.com/actions/github-script/pull/695)\n\n**Full Changelog**:\n<https://github.com/actions/github-script/compare/v8.0.0...v9.0.0>\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>dorny/test-reporter (dorny/test-reporter)</summary>\n\n###\n[`v3.0.0`](https://redirect.github.com/dorny/test-reporter/releases/tag/v3.0.0)\n\n[Compare\nSource](https://redirect.github.com/dorny/test-reporter/compare/v2.7.0...v3.0.0)\n\n**Note:** The v3 release requires NodeJS 24 runtime on GitHub Actions\nrunners.\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n- Upgrade action runtime to Node.js 24 by\n[@&#8203;dav-tb](https://redirect.github.com/dav-tb) in\n[#&#8203;738](https://redirect.github.com/dorny/test-reporter/pull/738)\n- Explicitly use lowest permissions required to run workflow by\n[@&#8203;jozefizso](https://redirect.github.com/jozefizso) in\n[#&#8203;745](https://redirect.github.com/dorny/test-reporter/pull/745)\n\n##### Other Changes\n\n- Bump\n[@&#8203;typescript-eslint/parser](https://redirect.github.com/typescript-eslint/parser)\nfrom 8.57.0 to 8.57.1 by\n[@&#8203;dependabot](https://redirect.github.com/dependabot)\\[bot] in\n[#&#8203;742](https://redirect.github.com/dorny/test-reporter/pull/742)\n- Bump\n[@&#8203;types/adm-zip](https://redirect.github.com/types/adm-zip) from\n0.5.7 to 0.5.8 by\n[@&#8203;dependabot](https://redirect.github.com/dependabot)\\[bot] in\n[#&#8203;743](https://redirect.github.com/dorny/test-reporter/pull/743)\n- Bump flatted from 3.4.1 to 3.4.2 by\n[@&#8203;dependabot](https://redirect.github.com/dependabot)\\[bot] in\n[#&#8203;744](https://redirect.github.com/dorny/test-reporter/pull/744)\n\n#### New Contributors\n\n- [@&#8203;dav-tb](https://redirect.github.com/dav-tb) made their first\ncontribution in\n[#&#8203;738](https://redirect.github.com/dorny/test-reporter/pull/738)\n\n**Full Changelog**:\n<https://github.com/dorny/test-reporter/compare/v2.7.0...v3.0.0>\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: (UTC)\n\n- Branch creation\n  - \"before 8am on the first day of the month\"\n- Automerge\n  - At any time (no schedule defined)\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
