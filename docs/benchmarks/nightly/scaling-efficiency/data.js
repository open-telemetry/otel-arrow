This now reindexes all the required columns, has support for\nmetrics, and has support for dictionary encoded columns.\n\nI also was able to uncomment most of the batching tests after this\nchange 🥳. One more to go which requires split.\n\nOther minor changes:\n\n- Made it so that `allowed_payload_types` returns payload types in the\nexact same order that they are stored. This is occasionally handy to\nhave.\n\nThings deferred:\n\n- Benchmarks. I had nothing to compare it to since the original didn't\nreindex a bunch of the necessary columns anyway like scope or resource\nid nor did it support dictionaries. I'll add these in when I get to the\nnext point..\n- Some optimization opportunities like using naive offsets instead of\nsorting and reindexing everything starting at 0. We need this path\nbecause it's possible to get into situations where we absolutely need to\ncompact things down to fit into u16, but we can likely skip it a decent\nportion of the time.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\nPart of #1926.\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nI added a big unit test suite.\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: albertlockett <a.lockett@f5.com>",

          "message": "Columnar query engine expression evaluation: simple arithmetic (#2126)\n\n# Change Summary\n\n<!--\nReplace with a brief summary of the change in this PR\n-->\n\nAdds a module to the columnar query engine with the ability evaluate\nsimple arithmetic expressions on OTAP record batches. For example, it\ncould evaluate expressions such as `severity_number + attributes[\"x\"] *\n2`.\n\nNote that the expression evaluation isn't yet integrated into any\n`PipelineStage` implementation, but the intention is that this can soon\nbe used to implement more advanced filtering, attribute insertion,\ncolumn updates and so on.\n\nWhile on the surface, this isolated simple arithmetic not appear\nterribly useful, the main/important contributions in this PR are to lay\ndown some foundations for future expression evaluation:\n\n**Transparent joins in the expression tree**\nThis PR adds is the ability to evaluate a set of DataFusion expressions\nwhile transparently joining data from different record batches as the\nexpression evaluates.\n\nFor example, consider we had `severity_number * 2 + attributes[\"x\"] +\nattributes[\"y\"]`, we'd need to first evaluate:\n- 1. `severity_number * 2`\n- 2. `attributes where key = \"x\"`, then select the value column based on\nthe type\n- 3. `attributes where key = \"y\"`, then select the value column based on\nthe type,\n\nThen we need to join these three expressions on the ID/parent ID\nrelationship, then perform the additions.\n\nThis PR builds the expression tree in such a way that it can manage\nwhere these joins need to happen on either side of a binary expression,\nand it performs the joins automatically during expression evaluation\nwhile keeping track of the ID scope/row order of the current data at\neach stage.\n\n**Type evaluation and coercion**\n\nWhile planning the expression, the planner attempts to keep track of\nwhat are the possible types that the expression could produce if it were\nto successfully evaluate. When it detects invalid types, it is able to\nproduce an error indicating an invalid expression.\n\nFor example, we'd be able to detect at planning time that `severity_text\n+ 2` is invalid, because text can't be added to a number.\n\nFor expressions where we can't determine that the types are invalid at\nplanning time, it will be determined and runtime and an error will be\nproduced when the expression evaluates on some batch. For example\n`attributes[\"x\"] + 2`, it's unknown whether `attributes[\"x\"]` is an\nint64, so it's assumed that the expression will produce an int64, and if\n`attributes[\"x\"]` is found not to be this type, an ExecutionError will\nbe produced.\n\nThe planner automatically coerces integer types when necessary.\nCurrently when adding two integers, they will be coerced into the\nlargest type that could contain the value, while keeping the signed-ness\nof one side. For example, uint8 + int32 will produce an int32. I realize\nthis type of automatic integer coercion is probably controversial, so in\nthe future I'm happy to get rid of this in favour of forcing explicit\ncasting if that is preferred.\n\n**Missing data / null propagation**\n\nWhen one side of an expression is null, for the purposes of arithmetic\nthe expression will evaluate to null. This includes the case of null\nvalues, missing attributes, missing columns, and missing optional record\nbatches.\n\nFor example: `attributes[\"x\"] + 2` would evaluate as null if the\nattribtues record batch was not present, there were no attributes with\n`key == \"x\"`, or the attributes where `key==\"x\"` had type empty, and so\non.\n\n**Relocated the projection code**\n\nAdds a new module called `pipeline::project` which has the projection\ncode that was previously inside the filter module. We need to project\nthe input record batches into a known schema to evaluate the\nexpressions, and also consider the expression evaluation to result in a\n`null` if the projection could evaluate due to missing data.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n<!--\nWe highly recommend correlation of every PR to an issue\n-->\n\n* Relates to https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/issues/2058\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nThere are 64 new unit tests covering these changes\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\n <!-- If yes, provide further info below -->\n\nNo\n\n\n## Future work/followups:\nThere are many, but most pressing are:\n- Other types of expression evaluation, including string expressions,\nunary math expressions, function invocation and bridging this with the\nfiltering code (for expressions that produce boolean arrays).\n- Integrating expression evaluation with various pipeline stages\nincluding those which set attributes, set values, and filtering\n- OPL Parser support for the type of expressions we're able to evaluate\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Laurent Quérel <laurent.querel@gmail.com>\nCo-authored-by: Laurent Quérel <l.querel@f5.com>",

          "message": "feat: handle Ack and Nack messages in OTAP Exporter. (#1994)\n\n# Change Summary\n\nPart of #1325 (see also #1324).\n\n## Problem: flaky test due to sleep-based synchronization.\n\nThe OTAP Exporter had two related issues:\n\n### 1. Dropped Context\n\nWhen the exporter received pipeline data (OtapPdata), it split the\nmessage into context and payload, then threw away the context:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/82f71508f8e598e78853335cce82195e894894cd/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/otap/src/otap_exporter.rs#L233-L235\n\nThe context carries routing information that tells the pipeline who to\nnotify when a message succeeds or fails. Without it, the exporter was a\nblack hole — data went in, but no confirmation ever came back.\n\n### 2. Flaky Test\n\nThe test `test_receiver_not_ready_on_start` had no way to know when the\nexporter finished processing, so it used arbitrary sleeps:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/82f71508f8e598e78853335cce82195e894894cd/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/otap/src/otap_exporter.rs#L866-L868\n\n\nhttps://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/82f71508f8e598e78853335cce82195e894894cd/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/otap/src/otap_exporter.rs#L870-L872\n\n\nhttps://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/82f71508f8e598e78853335cce82195e894894cd/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/otap/src/otap_exporter.rs#L883-L885\n\nOn a slow machine or under load, these might not be long enough. On a\nfast machine, they waste time.\n\n## Solution: thread context through for ACK/NACK.\n\nThe core idea is to preserve the `OtapPdata` context by using\n`take_payload()` instead of `into_parts()`.\n\nThis extracts the payload for gRPC transmission while keeping the\ncontext alive in the original OtapPdata. Then pass that context through\nthe entire streaming pipeline so it can be returned with ACK (success)\nor NACK (failure) notifications.\n\n## Key changes\n\n1. Preserve context at the entry point\n\n```rust\n  // Before: context discarded\n  let (_context, payload) = pdata.into_parts();\n\n  // After: payload extracted, context preserved\n  let payload = pdata.take_payload();\n```\n\n2. Pair each batch with its context through the pipeline\n\nThe internal channels changed from carrying just data to carrying\n(context, data) tuples:\n\n```rust\n  // Before\n  channel::<OtapArrowRecords>(64)\n\n  // After\n  channel::<(OtapPdata, OtapArrowRecords)>(64)\n```\n\n3. Correlate gRPC responses with their original requests\n\nThe exporter uses bidirectional gRPC streaming — requests go out on one\nstream, responses come back on another. A FIFO correlation channel pairs\nthem:\n\n```\n  create_req_stream ──sends pdata──→ [correlation channel] ──recv pdata──→ handle_res_stream\n    (yielded batch)                                                         (got response)\n```\n\nSince both streams are ordered, the first response always corresponds to\nthe first request.\n\n\n4. Send ACK/NACK in the main loop\n\n```rust\n  Some(PDataMetricsUpdate::Exported(signal_type, pdata)) => {\n      self.pdata_metrics.inc_exported(signal_type);\n      effect_handler.notify_ack(AckMsg::new(pdata)).await?;\n  },\n  Some(PDataMetricsUpdate::Failed(signal_type, pdata)) => {\n      self.pdata_metrics.inc_failed(signal_type);\n      effect_handler.notify_nack(NackMsg::new(\"export failed\", pdata)).await?;\n  },\n```\n\nThe effect_handler uses the context inside pdata to route ACK/NACK back\nthrough the pipeline.\n\n\n5. Replace sleeps with deterministic waits in the test\n\n```Rust\n  // Before: sleep and hope\n  tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(5)).await;\n\n  // After: wait for the actual event\n  timeout(Duration::from_secs(5), async {\n      loop {\n          match pipeline_ctrl_msg_rx.recv().await {\n              Ok(PipelineControlMsg::DeliverNack { .. }) => break,\n              Ok(_) => continue,\n              Err(_) => panic!(\"pipeline ctrl channel closed\"),\n          }\n      }\n  }).await.expect(\"Timed out waiting for NACK\");\n```\n\nThe test is now event-driven: it proceeds as soon as the NACK/ACK\narrives, with a 5-second timeout as a safety net.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/issues/1611\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\n <!-- If yes, provide further info below -->\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Drew Relmas <drewrelmas@gmail.com>",

Before this\nchange, we were simply using arrow's `concat_batches` helper function\nwith expects all the `RecordBatch`s to have the same schema. However,\nthis would cause a problem if some branch of the statement changes the\nschema.\n\nThis PR corrects the issue by using OTAP's\n[`concatenate`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/eaa4103326057ef68125244171801bc010cb3571/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/pdata/src/otap/transform/concatenate.rs#L75)\nfunction instead which correctly expands each `RecordBatch` into a\ncommon schema.\n\nThere's one pipeline stage that also writes new IDs to the rows with\nnull IDs (this happens when we assign attributes). In order for\n`concatenate` to produce a valid batch, we need to ensure the IDs are\nglobally unique. This PR adds a mechanism to initialize shared state for\ndifferent implementations of the same pipeline stage if they're being\nused in a nested branch within conditional pipeline stage, and uses it\nfor the purpose of ensuring unique IDs when filling in these null rows.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n<!--\nWe highly recommend correlation of every PR to an issue\n-->\n\n* Closes #2216 \n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nUnit tests\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo\n\n <!-- If yes, provide further info below -->",
