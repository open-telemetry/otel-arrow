          "message": "feat(engine): add NUMA-aware core placement planning (#3471)\n\n# Change Summary\n\n**_Note:_** The implementation is based on the design proposal #3317,\nand so subject to the design approval.\n\nThis PR moves pipeline core placement into the controller and makes it\ntopology-aware.\n\nToday, `core_count` pipelines each pick their own cores, starting from\nthe lowest. Two pipelines can silently land on the same cores and\ncompete, and nothing in the engine knows which NUMA node a core belongs\nto.\n\nThis change resolves placement explicitly, before any pipeline launches:\n\n- The engine discovers the process-visible CPU set and the CPU-to-NUMA\nmapping.\n- The controller plans `core_count` placement globally, accounting for\nother pipelines' reserved cores.\n- `core_count` pipelines receive exclusive cores instead of silently\noverlapping.\n- Explicit `core_set` is still honored, but now fails if a requested\ncore is hidden by process affinity or cgroup limits.\n- Startup, live rollout, rollback, and full-config reconcile all share\none placement model.\n\nThe default policy is deterministic NUMA packing: it keeps a pipeline on\na single NUMA node when possible, using stable lowest-node then\nlowest-core ordering. When topology is incomplete, it falls back to\ndeterministic visible-core ordering. The policy sits behind a small\nstrategy interface, so balancing or hardware-aware strategies can be\nadded later without touching placement call sites.\n\nThis PR also adds listener-group metadata as groundwork for future\nsocket-placement work. It does **not** bind sockets, enable\n`SO_REUSEPORT`, or attach eBPF selectors - there is no production\nruntime consumer yet.\n\nThe per-record data path is unchanged. Topology discovery and placement\nplanning run only at startup and during live control operations.\n\n## Breaking Behavior Changes\n\nThese configs now fail loudly instead of doing something surprising:\n\n- `core_count` no longer clamps to the available core count. Requesting\nmore cores than are visible is now a validation error.\n- Multiple `core_count` pipelines no longer overlap on the same first\ncores. Each gets an exclusive set, and startup or live update fails when\nthere aren't enough unreserved cores.\n- `core_count: 0` means \"all unreserved visible cores\" and can now fail\nif none remain.\n- Explicit `core_set` fails if any requested core is hidden by process\naffinity or cgroup CPU limits.\n- Full-config reconcile rejects placement transitions that need another\nlive pipeline to vacate cores first. Stage the shrink or delete first,\nthen apply the growth.\n\nExplicit `core_set`-to-`core_set` overlap is still allowed, as\ndeliberate operator intent.\n\n  * Closes #1837\n\nRelated context, not closed by this PR: #2155 (placement abstraction /\nbalancing), #2974 (socket + eBPF placement).\n\n  ## How are these changes tested?\n\n  New and updated unit coverage:\n\n- Linux topology discovery from sysfs, affinity, and cgroup v2 cpuset\nlimits\n- complete, partial, and unknown topology states, including disjoint\naffinity/cgroup visibility\n  - cpulist parse errors, oversized ranges, and duplicate CPU mappings\n  - NUMA-packing placement and deterministic fallback ordering\n  - strategy injection via the placement interface\n  - startup reservation conflicts across pipelines\n  - `core_count: 0` and omitted-count behavior\n  - explicit `core_set` hidden-core rejection\n  - live rollout, rollback, and reconcile placement handling\n  - conservative vacate-before-claim reconcile rejection\n\n  ## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\n  Yes — see **Breaking Behavior Changes** above.\n\n  ### Changelog\n\n  * [x] Added a `.chloggen/*.yaml` entry\n  * [ ] This PR is a `chore` (indicated in title)\n  * [ ] This is a documentation-only PR.",
