Supporting these topologies is required to\nenable more complex and expressive pipeline graphs.\n\nThis PR doesn't try to solve the broadcast fan-out limit.\n\n**Important note**: I refactored method `PipelineFactory::build` because\nits complexity had become difficult to follow. Most of the changes are\ndue to this refactoring rather than to the fan in support itself.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* Closes #1860\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nA unit test has been added into `pipeline_tests.rs` and I also did a\nmanual test.\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo change in the configuration file.",

Supporting these topologies is required to\nenable more complex and expressive pipeline graphs.\n\nThis PR doesn't try to solve the broadcast fan-out limit.\n\n**Important note**: I refactored method `PipelineFactory::build` because\nits complexity had become difficult to follow. Most of the changes are\ndue to this refactoring rather than to the fan in support itself.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* Closes #1860\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nA unit test has been added into `pipeline_tests.rs` and I also did a\nmanual test.\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo change in the configuration file.",

It\nis entirely possible that 72 pipelines instances would need more time to\nshutdown; until this can be investigated, its best to temporarily remove\nthis scenario.\n\nTo unblock perf tests, disabling the 24 core test temporarily. I'll\ninvestigate a proper fix next week.",

It\nis entirely possible that 72 pipelines instances would need more time to\nshutdown; until this can be investigated, its best to temporarily remove\nthis scenario.\n\nTo unblock perf tests, disabling the 24 core test temporarily.

Ordinarily we wouldn't encode attributes like this in\nOTAP because it we'd use the AttributeValuesType::Empty value in the\ntype column, but we handle it because it is valid arrow data since the\ncolumns are nullable.\n\n**Context:** \nwhen fixing #966 we added code to eagerly remove the transport optimized\nencoding from when transforming attributes, and noticed a significant\nregression in the performance benchmarks, especially on OTAP-ATTR-OTAP\nscenario because we do a round trip decode/encode of the transport\noptimized encoding.\n\n**Changes**\n\nThis PR specifically focuses on optimizing adding the transport\noptimized encoding for attributes, as this is where all the time was\nbeing spent. Adding this encoding involves sorting the attribute record\nbatch by type, key, value, then parent_id, and adding delta encoding to\nthe parent_id column for sequences where type, key and value are all\nequal to the previous row (unless value is null, or the type is Map or\nSlice).\n\nBefore this change, we were doing this sorting using arrow's\n`RowConverter`. We'd then do a second pass over the dataset to find\nsequences where type/key/value were equal, and apply the delta encoding\nto the parent_id column.\n\nAlthough using the `RowConverter` is sometimes [an efficient way to sort\nmultiple\ncolumns](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/11/07/multi-column-sorts-in-arrow-rust-part-2/),\nit's notable that the `RowConverter` actually expands the dictionaries\nfor all the columns before it sorts (see\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/4811). This is extremely\nexpensive for us since most of our attribute columns are dictionary\nencoded.\n\nThis PR changes the implementation to sort the attributes record batch\ndirectly, starting by combining type & key together (using the sorted\ndictionary values from the keys column), then sorting this hybrid\ncolumn. It then partitions the type column to identify the attributes\nvalue column for this segment of the sorted result, and partitions the\nkey column to find segments of the value column to sort together. For\neach segment, it sorts it, appends it to a builder for the new values\ncolumn. It then partitions the sorted segment of values and for each\nsegment takes the parent_ids for the value segment, sorts them, adds\ndelta encoding, and appends these to a buffer containing the encoded\nparent IDs. Then it combines everything together and produces the\nresult.\n\nThe advantages of this approach are a) it's a lot faster and b) we build\nup enough state during the sorting that we don't need to do a second\npass over the `RecordBatch` to add delta encoding.\n\nThere are quite a few transformations that happen, and I tried to do\nthese as efficiently as possible. This means working with arrow's\nbuffers directly in many places, instead of always using immutable\n`Array`s and compute kernels, which reduces quite a lot the amount of\nallocations.\n\n**Future Work/Followups**\nThere are some code paths I didn't spent a lot of time optimizing:\n- If the parent_id is a u32 which may be dictionary encoded, we simply\ncast it to a primitive array and then cast it back into a dict when\nwe're done. I did some quick testing and figure this adds ~10% overhead.\n- If the value type is something that could be in a dictionary (string,\nint, bytes, & ser columns), but isn't dictionary encoded, or if the type\nis boolean, the way we build up the result column allocates many small\narrays. This could be improved\n- If the key column is not dictionary encoded. I didn't spend very much\ntime optimizing this.\n\nThere's also probably some methods that we were using before to encode\nthe ID column that I need to go back and delete\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\nRelated to #1853 \n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nExisting unit tests plus new ones\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Joshua MacDonald <jmacd@users.noreply.github.com>\nCo-authored-by: Utkarsh Umesan Pillai <66651184+utpilla@users.noreply.github.com>",

Ordinarily we wouldn't encode attributes like this in\nOTAP because it we'd use the AttributeValuesType::Empty value in the\ntype column, but we handle it because it is valid arrow data since the\ncolumns are nullable.\n\n**Context:** \nwhen fixing #966 we added code to eagerly remove the transport optimized\nencoding from when transforming attributes, and noticed a significant\nregression in the performance benchmarks, especially on OTAP-ATTR-OTAP\nscenario because we do a round trip decode/encode of the transport\noptimized encoding.\n\n**Changes**\n\nThis PR specifically focuses on optimizing adding the transport\noptimized encoding for attributes, as this is where all the time was\nbeing spent. Adding this encoding involves sorting the attribute record\nbatch by type, key, value, then parent_id, and adding delta encoding to\nthe parent_id column for sequences where type, key and value are all\nequal to the previous row (unless value is null, or the type is Map or\nSlice).\n\nBefore this change, we were doing this sorting using arrow's\n`RowConverter`. We'd then do a second pass over the dataset to find\nsequences where type/key/value were equal, and apply the delta encoding\nto the parent_id column.\n\nAlthough using the `RowConverter` is sometimes [an efficient way to sort\nmultiple\ncolumns](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2022/11/07/multi-column-sorts-in-arrow-rust-part-2/),\nit's notable that the `RowConverter` actually expands the dictionaries\nfor all the columns before it sorts (see\nhttps://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/4811). This is extremely\nexpensive for us since most of our attribute columns are dictionary\nencoded.\n\nThis PR changes the implementation to sort the attributes record batch\ndirectly, starting by combining type & key together (using the sorted\ndictionary values from the keys column), then sorting this hybrid\ncolumn. It then partitions the type column to identify the attributes\nvalue column for this segment of the sorted result, and partitions the\nkey column to find segments of the value column to sort together. For\neach segment, it sorts it, appends it to a builder for the new values\ncolumn. It then partitions the sorted segment of values and for each\nsegment takes the parent_ids for the value segment, sorts them, adds\ndelta encoding, and appends these to a buffer containing the encoded\nparent IDs. Then it combines everything together and produces the\nresult.\n\nThe advantages of this approach are a) it's a lot faster and b) we build\nup enough state during the sorting that we don't need to do a second\npass over the `RecordBatch` to add delta encoding.\n\nThere are quite a few transformations that happen, and I tried to do\nthese as efficiently as possible. This means working with arrow's\nbuffers directly in many places, instead of always using immutable\n`Array`s and compute kernels, which reduces quite a lot the amount of\nallocations.\n\n**Future Work/Followups**\nThere are some code paths I didn't spent a lot of time optimizing:\n- If the parent_id is a u32 which may be dictionary encoded, we simply\ncast it to a primitive array and then cast it back into a dict when\nwe're done. I did some quick testing and figure this adds ~10% overhead.\n- If the value type is something that could be in a dictionary (string,\nint, bytes, & ser columns), but isn't dictionary encoded, or if the type\nis boolean, the way we build up the result column allocates many small\narrays. This could be improved\n- If the key column is not dictionary encoded. I didn't spend very much\ntime optimizing this.\n\nThere's also probably some methods that we were using before to encode\nthe ID column that I need to go back and delete\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\nRelated to #1853 \n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nExisting unit tests plus new ones\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Joshua MacDonald <jmacd@users.noreply.github.com>\nCo-authored-by: Utkarsh Umesan Pillai <66651184+utpilla@users.noreply.github.com>",

Updates OTel feature settings to\ndisable the OTel logging SDK from the build.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\nRemoves `ProviderMode::OpenTelemetry`, the OTel logging SDK and its\nassociated configuration (service::telemetry::logs::processors::*).\n\nFixes #1576.\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nYes.\n\n**Note: this removes the potential to use the OpenTelemetry tracing\nsupport via the opentelemetry tracing appender. However, we view tracing\ninstrumentation as having limited value until otap-dataflow is properly\ninstrumented for tracing. When this happens, we are likely to use an\ninternal tracing pipeline.**\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Utkarsh Umesan Pillai <66651184+utpilla@users.noreply.github.com>",

I've fixed a lot of bugs, improved performance over the\nexisting concatenate function quite a bit (mostly by simplifying\nimplementation) and took some steps to prepare for phase 2 which will\nhopefully improve the interface for this module.\n\nMajor changes:\n- Moved this to the transform module, I plan to treat concatenation,\nsplitting, and maybe also re-indexing as additional transformations on\nOtapArrowRecords similar to removing transport optimized encodings\n- Added an (in my opinion) better `record_batch!` macro that supports\ndictionaries\n- Many bugs fixed for schema selection (especially structs) and\nnullability\n- Bugs fixed for boundary conditions for dictionary cardinality\nselection\n- Turned a lot of potential panics into schema mismatch errors\n- Lots of additional unit tests\n\nThings I deferred:\n\n- Changing the interface to concatenate to be based on OtapBatchStore\ndeferred to phase 2 because we can't plug it into the existing code\neasily\n- Moving reindexing into the concatenate operation deferred to phase 2\nbecause we couldn't plug it into the existing code easily\n- Some performance improvements mentioned in TODOs\n\nBenchmark results:\n\n| Configuration | New Implementation | Old Implementation | Speedup |\n|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|\n| 10 inputs, 5 points | 28.18 us | 101.03 us | **3.58x** |\n| 10 inputs, 50 points | 29.82 us | 110.47 us | **3.70x** |\n| 100 inputs, 5 points | 246.37 us | 951.29 us | **3.86x** |\n| 100 inputs, 50 points | 267.27 us | 1,020.0 us | **3.82x** |\n| 1000 inputs, 5 points | 4.47 ms | 16.62 ms | **3.72x** |\n| 1000 inputs, 50 points | 4.98 ms | 17.44 ms | **3.50x** |\n\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\nRelated to #1926 \n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nMany unit tests\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo.",

          "message": "feat(quiver): skip expired WAL entries during replay (#1984)\n\n# Change Summary\n\nDuring WAL replay, entries older than the configured `max_age` retention\nare now skipped rather than replayed into new segments. Without this\nfiltering, replaying expired WAL entries would effectively reset their\nage to zero, causing data to be retained longer than intended by the\nconfigured policy. The cutoff is computed once before the replay loop\nand compared against each entry's ingestion_time (with no assumption\nabout WAL ordering). Skipped entries advance the cursor so they won't be\nretried, and the expired_bundles counter is incremented so operators\nhave visibility into filtered data. When *all* replayed entries are\nexpired (nothing is replayed), the cursor is explicitly persisted to the\nsidecar to avoid redundant re-scanning on subsequent restarts.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* Closes #1980\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nTwo new tests cover the mixed old/fresh filtering case and the\nall-expired edge case, the latter including a third engine reopen to\nverify cursor persistence.\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo, this is an optimization to the WAL recovery behavior. No config or\nuser-facing changes.",

Without this\nfiltering, replaying expired WAL entries would effectively reset their\nage to zero, causing data to be retained longer than intended by the\nconfigured policy. The cutoff is computed once before the replay loop\nand compared against each entry's ingestion_time (with no assumption\nabout WAL ordering). Skipped entries advance the cursor so they won't be\nretried, and the expired_bundles counter is incremented so operators\nhave visibility into filtered data. When *all* replayed entries are\nexpired (nothing is replayed), the cursor is explicitly persisted to the\nsidecar to avoid redundant re-scanning on subsequent restarts.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* Closes #1980\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nTwo new tests cover the mixed old/fresh filtering case and the\nall-expired edge case, the latter including a third engine reopen to\nverify cursor persistence.\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo, this is an optimization to the WAL recovery behavior. No config or\nuser-facing changes.",

          "message": "feat(quiver): skip expired WAL entries during replay (#1984)\n\n# Change Summary\n\nDuring WAL replay, entries older than the configured `max_age` retention\nare now skipped rather than replayed into new segments. Without this\nfiltering, replaying expired WAL entries would effectively reset their\nage to zero, causing data to be retained longer than intended by the\nconfigured policy. The cutoff is computed once before the replay loop\nand compared against each entry's ingestion_time (with no assumption\nabout WAL ordering). Skipped entries advance the cursor so they won't be\nretried, and the expired_bundles counter is incremented so operators\nhave visibility into filtered data. When *all* replayed entries are\nexpired (nothing is replayed), the cursor is explicitly persisted to the\nsidecar to avoid redundant re-scanning on subsequent restarts.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* Closes #1980\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nTwo new tests cover the mixed old/fresh filtering case and the\nall-expired edge case, the latter including a third engine reopen to\nverify cursor persistence.\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo, this is an optimization to the WAL recovery behavior. No config or\nuser-facing changes.",

          "message": "feat(quiver): skip expired WAL entries during replay (#1984)\n\n# Change Summary\n\nDuring WAL replay, entries older than the configured `max_age` retention\nare now skipped rather than replayed into new segments. Without this\nfiltering, replaying expired WAL entries would effectively reset their\nage to zero, causing data to be retained longer than intended by the\nconfigured policy. The cutoff is computed once before the replay loop\nand compared against each entry's ingestion_time (with no assumption\nabout WAL ordering). Skipped entries advance the cursor so they won't be\nretried, and the expired_bundles counter is incremented so operators\nhave visibility into filtered data. When *all* replayed entries are\nexpired (nothing is replayed), the cursor is explicitly persisted to the\nsidecar to avoid redundant re-scanning on subsequent restarts.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* Closes #1980\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nTwo new tests cover the mixed old/fresh filtering case and the\nall-expired edge case, the latter including a third engine reopen to\nverify cursor persistence.\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo, this is an optimization to the WAL recovery behavior. No config or\nuser-facing changes.",

          "message": "feat(quiver): skip expired WAL entries during replay (#1984)\n\n# Change Summary\n\nDuring WAL replay, entries older than the configured `max_age` retention\nare now skipped rather than replayed into new segments. Without this\nfiltering, replaying expired WAL entries would effectively reset their\nage to zero, causing data to be retained longer than intended by the\nconfigured policy. The cutoff is computed once before the replay loop\nand compared against each entry's ingestion_time (with no assumption\nabout WAL ordering). Skipped entries advance the cursor so they won't be\nretried, and the expired_bundles counter is incremented so operators\nhave visibility into filtered data. When *all* replayed entries are\nexpired (nothing is replayed), the cursor is explicitly persisted to the\nsidecar to avoid redundant re-scanning on subsequent restarts.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* Closes #1980\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nTwo new tests cover the mixed old/fresh filtering case and the\nall-expired edge case, the latter including a third engine reopen to\nverify cursor persistence.\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo, this is an optimization to the WAL recovery behavior. No config or\nuser-facing changes.",

Inspired by\n`severity_text` reference in #1722, been on the back of my mind for a\nwhile.\n\nThis is still somewhat incomplete, could need more wiring for\nuser-provided aliases in bridge, but for the moment just doing it for\nknown OpenTelemetry fields.",

Inspired by\n`severity_text` reference in #1722, been on the back of my mind for a\nwhile.\n\nThis is still somewhat incomplete, could need more wiring for\nuser-provided aliases in bridge, but for the moment just doing it for\nknown OpenTelemetry fields.",

          "message": "Add support for schema key aliases in query engine Parsers (#1725)\n\nDraft PR to open discussion - The current `otlp-bridge` for the\n`recordset` engine uses the OpenTelemetry [log data model\nspec](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/data-model.md)\nfor its initial schema keys (`Attributes`, `Timestamp`,\n`ObservedTimestamp`, `SeverityText`, etc).\n\nHowever, many well-versed in the OpenTelemetry space may be more used to\nthe snake case representation (`attributes`, `time_unix_nano`,\n`observed_time_unix_nano`, `severity_text`, etc) from the\n[proto](https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/main/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/pdata/src/views/otlp/proto/logs.rs)\nrepresentation.\n\nDo we have any significant risks if we plan to support both? Inspired by\n`severity_text` reference in #1722, been on the back of my mind for a\nwhile.\n\nThis is still somewhat incomplete, could need more wiring for\nuser-provided aliases in bridge, but for the moment just doing it for\nknown OpenTelemetry fields.",

          "message": "Add support for schema key aliases in query engine Parsers (#1725)\n\nDraft PR to open discussion - The current `otlp-bridge` for the\n`recordset` engine uses the OpenTelemetry [log data model\nspec](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/data-model.md)\nfor its initial schema keys (`Attributes`, `Timestamp`,\n`ObservedTimestamp`, `SeverityText`, etc).\n\nHowever, many well-versed in the OpenTelemetry space may be more used to\nthe snake case representation (`attributes`, `time_unix_nano`,\n`observed_time_unix_nano`, `severity_text`, etc) from the\n[proto](https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/blob/main/rust/otap-dataflow/crates/pdata/src/views/otlp/proto/logs.rs)\nrepresentation.\n\nDo we have any significant risks if we plan to support both? Inspired by\n`severity_text` reference in #1722, been on the back of my mind for a\nwhile.\n\nThis is still somewhat incomplete, could need more wiring for\nuser-provided aliases in bridge, but for the moment just doing it for\nknown OpenTelemetry fields.",

This now reindexes all the required columns, has support for\nmetrics, and has support for dictionary encoded columns.\n\nI also was able to uncomment most of the batching tests after this\nchange 🥳. One more to go which requires split.\n\nOther minor changes:\n\n- Made it so that `allowed_payload_types` returns payload types in the\nexact same order that they are stored. This is occasionally handy to\nhave.\n\nThings deferred:\n\n- Benchmarks. I had nothing to compare it to since the original didn't\nreindex a bunch of the necessary columns anyway like scope or resource\nid nor did it support dictionaries. I'll add these in when I get to the\nnext point..\n- Some optimization opportunities like using naive offsets instead of\nsorting and reindexing everything starting at 0. We need this path\nbecause it's possible to get into situations where we absolutely need to\ncompact things down to fit into u16, but we can likely skip it a decent\nportion of the time.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\nPart of #1926.\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nI added a big unit test suite.\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: albertlockett <a.lockett@f5.com>",

This now reindexes all the required columns, has support for\nmetrics, and has support for dictionary encoded columns.\n\nI also was able to uncomment most of the batching tests after this\nchange 🥳. One more to go which requires split.\n\nOther minor changes:\n\n- Made it so that `allowed_payload_types` returns payload types in the\nexact same order that they are stored. This is occasionally handy to\nhave.\n\nThings deferred:\n\n- Benchmarks. I had nothing to compare it to since the original didn't\nreindex a bunch of the necessary columns anyway like scope or resource\nid nor did it support dictionaries. I'll add these in when I get to the\nnext point..\n- Some optimization opportunities like using naive offsets instead of\nsorting and reindexing everything starting at 0. We need this path\nbecause it's possible to get into situations where we absolutely need to\ncompact things down to fit into u16, but we can likely skip it a decent\nportion of the time.\n\n## What issue does this PR close?\n\nPart of #1926.\n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nI added a big unit test suite.\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nNo.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: albertlockett <a.lockett@f5.com>",

I believe\n`one_of` better reflect the underlying implementation (was never really\na round robin strategy as the channel receivers were competing\ntogether).\n- broadcast is currently parsed but rejected for multi-destination edges\n(reserved for future support)\n    - single-destination edges treat dispatch as no-op\n- Refactored PipelineConfigBuilder API for readability in tests:\n- one_of(src, targets) and broadcast(src, targets) for default output\n- one_of_output(src, output, targets) and broadcast_output(...) for\nexplicit output\n    - added to(src, dst) and to_output(src, output, dst) aliases\n- Updated engine wiring internals and channel identity labeling to use\ndispatch policy terminology (one_of/broadcast) consistently.\n- Updated docs and examples to the new model:\n\n**To do: update the configuration of our continuous benchmarks.**\n  \n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* Closes #1970 \n* Closes #1828\n* Closes #1829 \n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nAll unit tests passed\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nThe structure of the configuration files have changed.",

I believe\n`one_of` better reflect the underlying implementation (was never really\na round robin strategy as the channel receivers were competing\ntogether).\n- broadcast is currently parsed but rejected for multi-destination edges\n(reserved for future support)\n    - single-destination edges treat dispatch as no-op\n- Refactored PipelineConfigBuilder API for readability in tests:\n- one_of(src, targets) and broadcast(src, targets) for default output\n- one_of_output(src, output, targets) and broadcast_output(...) for\nexplicit output\n    - added to(src, dst) and to_output(src, output, dst) aliases\n- Updated engine wiring internals and channel identity labeling to use\ndispatch policy terminology (one_of/broadcast) consistently.\n- Updated docs and examples to the new model:\n\n**To do: update the configuration of our continuous benchmarks.**\n  \n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* Closes #1970 \n* Closes #1828\n* Closes #1829 \n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nAll unit tests passed\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nThe structure of the configuration files have changed.",

I believe\n`one_of` better reflect the underlying implementation (was never really\na round robin strategy as the channel receivers were competing\ntogether).\n- broadcast is currently parsed but rejected for multi-destination edges\n(reserved for future support)\n    - single-destination edges treat dispatch as no-op\n- Refactored PipelineConfigBuilder API for readability in tests:\n- one_of(src, targets) and broadcast(src, targets) for default output\n- one_of_output(src, output, targets) and broadcast_output(...) for\nexplicit output\n    - added to(src, dst) and to_output(src, output, dst) aliases\n- Updated engine wiring internals and channel identity labeling to use\ndispatch policy terminology (one_of/broadcast) consistently.\n- Updated docs and examples to the new model:\n\n**To do: update the configuration of our continuous benchmarks.**\n  \n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* Closes #1970 \n* Closes #1828\n* Closes #1829 \n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nAll unit tests passed\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nThe structure of the configuration files have changed.",

I believe\n`one_of` better reflect the underlying implementation (was never really\na round robin strategy as the channel receivers were competing\ntogether).\n- broadcast is currently parsed but rejected for multi-destination edges\n(reserved for future support)\n    - single-destination edges treat dispatch as no-op\n- Refactored PipelineConfigBuilder API for readability in tests:\n- one_of(src, targets) and broadcast(src, targets) for default output\n- one_of_output(src, output, targets) and broadcast_output(...) for\nexplicit output\n    - added to(src, dst) and to_output(src, output, dst) aliases\n- Updated engine wiring internals and channel identity labeling to use\ndispatch policy terminology (one_of/broadcast) consistently.\n- Updated docs and examples to the new model:\n\n**To do: update the configuration of our continuous benchmarks.**\n  \n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* Closes #1970 \n* Closes #1828\n* Closes #1829 \n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nAll unit tests passed\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nThe structure of the configuration files have changed.",

I believe\n`one_of` better reflect the underlying implementation (was never really\na round robin strategy as the channel receivers were competing\ntogether).\n- broadcast is currently parsed but rejected for multi-destination edges\n(reserved for future support)\n    - single-destination edges treat dispatch as no-op\n- Refactored PipelineConfigBuilder API for readability in tests:\n- one_of(src, targets) and broadcast(src, targets) for default output\n- one_of_output(src, output, targets) and broadcast_output(...) for\nexplicit output\n    - added to(src, dst) and to_output(src, output, dst) aliases\n- Updated engine wiring internals and channel identity labeling to use\ndispatch policy terminology (one_of/broadcast) consistently.\n- Updated docs and examples to the new model:\n\n**To do: update the configuration of our continuous benchmarks.**\n  \n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* Closes #1970 \n* Closes #1828\n* Closes #1829 \n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nAll unit tests passed\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nThe structure of the configuration files have changed.",

I believe\n`one_of` better reflect the underlying implementation (was never really\na round robin strategy as the channel receivers were competing\ntogether).\n- broadcast is currently parsed but rejected for multi-destination edges\n(reserved for future support)\n    - single-destination edges treat dispatch as no-op\n- Refactored PipelineConfigBuilder API for readability in tests:\n- one_of(src, targets) and broadcast(src, targets) for default output\n- one_of_output(src, output, targets) and broadcast_output(...) for\nexplicit output\n    - added to(src, dst) and to_output(src, output, dst) aliases\n- Updated engine wiring internals and channel identity labeling to use\ndispatch policy terminology (one_of/broadcast) consistently.\n- Updated docs and examples to the new model:\n\n**To do: update the configuration of our continuous benchmarks.**\n  \n## What issue does this PR close?\n\n* Closes #1970 \n* Closes #1828\n* Closes #1829 \n\n## How are these changes tested?\n\nAll unit tests passed\n\n## Are there any user-facing changes?\n\nThe structure of the configuration files have changed.",
