# OTel-Arrow Project Phases

## Overview

This document outlines a phased implementation approach for the
OTel-Arrow project. For a complete project overview, please refer to
the top-level [README](../README.md).

OTel-Arrow aims to integrate OpenTelemetry with Apache Arrow to enable
high-performance telemetry data processing. The project will evolve
through multiple phases, each delivering specific functionality while
incrementally expanding the project's capabilities and scope.

## Phase 0: Foundation documents

**Timeline:** 2021-2023

**Key Deliverables:**

- Initial demo created by @lquerel showcasing the concept ([YouTube
  presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dGGjREaggY), December 2021)
- OpenTelemetry Technical Committee sponsorship by @jmacd
- OpenTelemetry Enhancement Proposal (OTEP) for columnar encoding
  ([OTEP-0156](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/oteps/0156-columnar-encoding.md)).

**Success Criteria:**

- Demonstration of feasibility and potential performance benefits
- OpenTelemetry spec-approvers accepted the OTEP, June 2023.

## Phase 1: Arrow as a wire protocol - improving compression between collectors

**Objective:** Establish the mapping between OpenTelemetry data types
and Apache Arrow columnar format, with emphasis on streaming
compression results.

**Timeline:** 2023-2024

**Key Deliverables:**

- Arrow schema definitions for OpenTelemetry spans, metrics, and logs
  ([OTAP
  protocol](../proto/opentelemetry/proto/experimental/arrow/v1/arrow_service.proto),
  [data model](./data_model.md))
- Reference implementation for serializing/deserializing between
  OpenTelemetry Collector format (`pdata`) and OTel-Arrow format in
  Golang (this repository)
- Define multi-variate OTel-Arrow metrics representation compatible
  with OpenTelemetry metrics data model
  ([design](./multivariate-design.md))
- Benchmark suite comparing CPU/memory/compression performance against
  OTLP ([results](./benchmarks.md))
- Unit tests and validation tools (this repository)
- OpenTelemetry Collector-contrib
  [exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/exporter/otelarrowexporter/README.md)
  and
  [receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/otelarrowreceiver/README.md)
  components
- [Project kick-off blog post](https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2023/otel-arrow/)
- [Production readiness blog post, including compression study
  results](https://opentelemetry.io/blog/2024/otel-arrow-production).

**Success Criteria:**

- 100% compatibility with OTLP; non-lossy bi-directional translation
  (including multi-variate metrics)
- Seamless transition supporting combined OTAP/OTLP transport modes on
  the same port
- Uses Apache Arrow IPC over gRPC streams for compatibility with
  OpenTelemetry ecosystem
- Compression improvements of at least 30% for all signals, typical
  50% improvement compared with gRPC-OTLP/zstd.

**Restrictions and governance:**

- Although the prototype and original demo was given in Rust, the
  project commits to working in the Golang ecosystem
- Compatibility commitment: the project aims at making OTLP and OTAP
  as compatible as possible and will support all signals through
  Golang components in Collector-Contrib.

## Phase 2: Arrow as an in-memory data representation - improving data processing speed inside the Collector

**Objective:** Establish a foundation for working with OTel-Arrow data
in the Collector, for access to the Arrow ecosystem.

**Timeline:** 2025

**Key Deliverables:**

- In-process OTAP pipeline implemented as Rust libraries
- Explore API design for column-oriented pipeline data object based on
  OTAP data frames
- Prototype for DataFusion integration with OpenTelemetry data,
  OTTL-transform feasibility study
- Benchmarks measuring OTAP and OTLP pipelines in Rust and Golang.

**Success Criteria:**

- Interoperability testing between Golang components from Phase 1
- OTAP/Rust gains 2x to 10x in data processing speed compared with
  OTLP/Golang, depending on pipeline configuration and complexity, at
  lower memory cost, and with better compression
- Summarize what it would look like to implement OTAP pipelines
  directly in Golang
- Feasibility study: how to integrate Rust OTAP pipelines as foreign
  function calls from Golang
- Demonstration of the value of integrating OpenTelemetry data with
  Apache Arrow.

**Restrictions and governance:**

- We are not building a Rust Collector; we are building OTAP pipelines
  as embeddable software libraries with access to the Apache Arrow
  ecosystem in Rust
- We are not building a Rust Collector; we are evaluating an
  end-to-end OTAP pipeline, including an experimental "OTAP-direct"
  SDK in Rust
- We will not publish software in source or binary form that acts like
  a stand-alone Collector
- We will (intentionally) not support parsing YAML configuration files
  to configure pipeline graphs
- We will not interfere with OpenTelemetry Collector or OpenTelemetry
  Rust during this phase by asking those teams to review/approve our
  work.

## Future Phases

Additional project phases will be defined as the project evolves,
based on the outcome of earlier phases.

Phase N+1 planning will be discussed when Phase N comes to a close.
