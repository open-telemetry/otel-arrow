# Rust components

This folder contains various Rust projects of varying stages of maturity.

The `otap-dataflow/` folder contains the main deliverable of Phase 2 of the
otel-arrow project, [as mentioned in its README](./otap-dataflow/README.md).

All other folders are either experimental or initial donations of components
that have yet to be incorporated into the main library.
