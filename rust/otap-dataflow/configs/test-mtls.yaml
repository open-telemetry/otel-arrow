# Test configuration for mTLS (mutual authentication)
# This demonstrates OTLP receiver with mTLS -> OTLP exporter with mTLS
#
# How to test:
# 1. Generate certificates: ./scripts/generate-test-certs.sh
# 2. Start the collector: cargo run --features experimental-tls -- --config configs/test-mtls.yaml
# 3. Send test data to the receiver on https://127.0.0.1:4317 with client cert
