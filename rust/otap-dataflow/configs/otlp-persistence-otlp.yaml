# OTLP → Persistence → OTLP pipeline example
#
# This configuration demonstrates the persistence processor providing
# durable buffering for OTLP data. By default, OTLP bytes are stored as
# opaque binary for efficient pass-through (near-zero CPU overhead).
# Set otlp_handling: convert_to_arrow to enable querying on stored data.
#
# Build with: cargo build --release --features persistence
# Run with:   ./target/release/df_engine --pipeline configs/otlp-persistence-otlp.yaml
#
# To test, run a backend OTLP receiver on port 4318, then send OTLP data to port 4317.
