# Contributing to the OTAP Pipeline project

The OTAP Pipeline project is a part of
the [OTEL Arrow Project](https://github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow).

Additionally, OTEL Arrow has its own CNCF slack channel
at [#otel-arrow](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C07S4Q67LTF).

## Our Development Process

### How to build  and test a change

Run `cargo xtask check` to check the structure of the project.

### How to send Pull Request

TODO - add any special care/comments we want for clean repo.

### How to Receive Comments

- If the PR is not ready for review, please put `[WIP]` in the title or mark it
  as draft.
- Make sure CLA is signed and all required CI checks are clear.
- Submit small, focused PRs addressing a single concern/issue.
- Make sure the PR title reflects the contribution.
- Write a summary that helps understand the change.
- Include usage examples in the summary, where applicable.
- Include benchmarks (before/after) in the summary, for contributions that are
  performance enhancements.

### How to Get PRs Merged

A PR is considered to be ready to merge when:

- It has received approval from at least one Approver / Maintainer.
- Major feedback is resolved.

Any Maintainer can merge the PR once it is ready to merge. Note, that some PRs
may not be merged immediately if the repo is in the process of a release and the
maintainers decided to defer the PR to the next release train. Also, maintainers
may decide to wait for more than one approval for certain PRs, particularly ones
that are affecting multiple areas, or topics that may warrant more discussion.
