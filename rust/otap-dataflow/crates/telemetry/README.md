# Telemetry SDK (schema-first, multivariate, NUMA-aware)

A low-overhead, NUMA-aware telemetry SDK that turns a declarative schema into a
type-safe Rust API for emitting richly structured, multivariate metrics. It is
designed for engines that run a thread-per-core and require predictable latency
while still exporting high-fidelity operational data.

## Core principles

1. **Schema-first**: You declare a metric schema (attributes + instrument kinds)
   and derive strongly typed metric sets. This eliminates stringly-typed
   lookups, guarantees field ordering, and lets downstream tooling reason about
   the data shape at compile time.
2. **Native multivariate metrics**: A metric set groups multiple instruments
   that share identical attribute tuples and timestamps. Collection exports
   sparse non-zero field/value pairs, avoiding per-field overhead and reducing
   wire size.
3. **Performance focus**: Counter increments are zero-cost in steady state (no
   atomics, no branching beyond range checks) by leveraging per-core ownership
   and cache alignment. The cold path (flush, aggregate, encode) is NUMA-aware
   and batch oriented, separating mutation from collection.
4. **Auto-describing**: From the same schema we generate OpenTelemetry semantic
   descriptors so the system can describe its own telemetry: instrument kinds,
   units, brief docs, and attribute keys. Exporters can attach this metadata
   once, enabling self-describing streams.

## Architectural highlights

- Per-core metric sets: each core mutates only its own instance => no cross-core
  contention.
- Reset-on-flush semantics: values accumulate for a cadence (e.g. 100 ms) then
  are atomically snapshotted and zeroed, yielding deltas by construction.
- Sparse enumeration: only non-zero fields are walked; zeroing touches only
  dirty counters.
- Descriptor & schema statics: each generated metric set exposes a
  `MetricsDescriptor` with an ordered slice of `MetricsField` (name, unit,
  instrument kind, brief). Similarly, a `AttributesDescriptor` provides
  attribute keys and their types.
- Registry & reflection: a global registry tracks live metric sets, enabling
  periodic flush loops without bespoke wiring.
- Transport decoupling (aka bottom half of the SDK): snapshot batches move over
  MPSC queues to aggregation / export workers.

## Macros

The `#[metric_set]` macro generates a strongly typed metric set from a Rust
struct definition.

The `#[attribute_set]` macro generates a strongly typed attribute set from a
Rust struct definition.

See the [telemetry-macros crate](../telemetry-macros) for details.

## Roadmap

- OTLP (push) export via Rust OpenTelemetry SDK.
- Generate OpenTelemetry Semantic Registry from the schema.
- Generate Telemetry client SDK from custom registry and Weaver.
- Structured events and spans.
- NUMA-aware aggregation.
