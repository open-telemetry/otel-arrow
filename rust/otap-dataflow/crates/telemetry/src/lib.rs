//! Telemetry system used to instrument the OTAP engine. This system currently focuses on metrics
//! but will be extended to cover events and traces.
//!
//! Our instrumentation framework follows a type-safe approach with the goals of being:
//!
//! * less error-prone: everything is encoded in the type system as structs, field names, and
//!   annotations to provide metadata (e.g. unit).
//! * more performant: a collection of metrics is encoded as a struct with fields of counter
//!   type (no hashmap or other dynamic data structures). Several metrics that share the same
//!   attributes donâ€™t have to define those attributes multiple times.
//! * compatible with the semantic conventions: the definition of the metrics produced by the engine
//!   will be available in the semantic convention format.
//!
//! Future directions:
//!
//! * NUMA-aware architecture (soon)
//! * Native support for events
//! * Native support for traces
//! * Export of a registry compatible with the semantic registry format
//! * Client SDK generation with Weaver
