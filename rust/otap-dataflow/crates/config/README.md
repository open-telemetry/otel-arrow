# OTAP Pipeline Configuration Model

Status: **WIP**

This crate contains the definition of a configuration model for defining
pipelines. The configuration consists of nodes
and edges. A validation system is provided to ensure that the configuration
forms a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). A
basic optimization mechanism is also included to optimize the DAG.

This crate is currently under development.
