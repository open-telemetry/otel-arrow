//! Node configuration specification.
//!
//! A node is a fundamental unit in our data processing pipeline, representing either a receiver
//! (source), processor, exporter (sink), or connector (linking pipelines).
//!
//! A node can have multiple outgoing named ports, each connected to a hyper-edge that defines how
//! data flows from this node to one or more target nodes.

/// Each node contains its own settings and defines how it connects to downstream nodes via out_ports.

/// - The hyper-edge configuration determines which downstream nodes are connected,
///   and how messages are routed (broadcast, round-robin, ...).
