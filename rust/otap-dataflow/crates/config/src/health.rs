//! Health policy defining liveness and readiness probes.
//!
//! ## Liveness Probe
//!
//! Used to decide whether to restart the server/container. Typical use cases:
//! - Detect deadlocks or stuck event loops.
//! - Force a restart when the app can't recover by itself.
//! - Should be cheap and internal (not dependent on external systems).
//!
//! ## Readiness Probe
//!
//! Used to decide whether the Pod should receive traffic. Typical use cases:
//! - Gate traffic until startup work is done (pipeline deployed and running).
//! - Temporarily remove the Pod from load balancing when it can't serve correctly.
//! - Can check key dependencies, but avoid making it too fragile.
