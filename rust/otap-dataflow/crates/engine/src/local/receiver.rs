//! Set of traits and structures used to implement receivers.
//!
//! A receiver is an ingress node that feeds a pipeline with data from external sources while
//! performing the necessary conversions to produce messages in a format recognized by the rest of
//! downstream pipeline nodes (e.g. OTLP or OTAP message format).
//!
//! A receiver can operate in various ways, including:
//!
//! 1. Listening on a socket to receive push-based telemetry data,
//! 2. Being notified of changes in a local directory (e.g. log file monitoring),
//! 3. Actively scraping an endpoint to retrieve the latest metrics from a system,
//! 4. Or using any other method to receive or extract telemetry data from external sources.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. The receiver is instantiated and configured.
//! 2. The `start` method is called, which begins the receiver's operation.
//! 3. The receiver processes both internal control messages and external data.
//! 4. The receiver shuts down when it receives a `Shutdown` control message or encounters a fatal
//!    error.
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! This implementation is designed for use in both single-threaded and multi-threaded environments.
//! The `Receiver` trait requires the `Send` bound, enabling the use of thread-safe types.
//!
//! # Scalability
//!
//! To ensure scalability, the pipeline engine will start multiple instances of the same pipeline in
//! parallel on different cores, each with its own receiver instance.
