//! Trait and structures used to implement local exporters (!Send).
//!
//! An exporter is an egress node that sends data from a pipeline to external systems, performing
//! the necessary conversions from the internal pdata format to the format required by the external
//! system.
//!
//! Exporters can operate in various ways, including:
//!
//! 1. Sending telemetry data to remote endpoints via network protocols,
//! 2. Writing data to files or databases,
//! 3. Pushing data to message queues or event buses,
//! 4. Or any other method of exporting telemetry data to external systems.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. The exporter is instantiated and configured
//! 2. The `start` method is called, which begins the exporter's operation
//! 3. The exporter processes both internal control messages and pipeline data (pdata)
//! 4. The exporter shuts down when it receives a `Shutdown` control message or encounters a fatal
//!    error
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! This implementation is designed to be used in a single-threaded environment.
//! The `Exporter` trait does not require the `Send` bound, allowing for the use of non-thread-safe
//! types.
//!
//! # Scalability
//!
//! To ensure scalability, the pipeline engine will start multiple instances of the same pipeline
//! in parallel on different cores, each with its own exporter instance.

    /// Starts the exporter and begins exporting incoming data.
    ///
    /// The pipeline engine will call this function to start the exporter in a separate task.
    /// Exporters are assigned their own dedicated task at pipeline initialization because their
    /// primary function involves interacting with the external world, and the pipeline has no
    /// prior knowledge of when these interactions will occur.
    ///
    /// The exporter is taken as `Box<Self>` so the method takes ownership of the exporter once `start` is called.
    /// This lets it move into an independent task, after which the pipeline can only
    /// reach it through the control-message channel.
    ///
    /// Because ownership is now exclusive, the code inside `start` can freely use
    /// `&mut self` to update internal state without worrying about aliasing or
    /// borrowing rules at the call-site. That keeps the public API simple (no
    /// exterior `&mut` references to juggle) while still allowing the exporter to
    /// mutate itself as much as it needs during its run loop.
    ///
    /// Exporters are expected to process both internal control messages and pipeline data messages,
    /// prioritizing control messages over data messages. This prioritization guarantee is ensured
    /// by the `MessageChannel` implementation.
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// - `msg_chan`: A channel to receive pdata or control messages. Control messages are
    ///   prioritized over pdata messages.
    /// - `effect_handler`: A handler to perform side effects such as network operations.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Returns an [`Error`] if an unrecoverable error occurs.
    ///
    /// # Cancellation Safety
    ///
    /// This method should be cancellation safe and clean up any resources when dropped.
