//! Set of traits and structures used to implement processors.
//!
//! A processor is a node in the pipeline that transforms, filters, or otherwise processes messages
//! as they flow through the pipeline. Processors can perform operations such as:
//!
//! 1. Filtering messages based on certain criteria
//! 2. Transforming message content or format
//! 3. Aggregating multiple messages into a single message
//! 4. Splitting a single message into multiple messages
//! 5. Adding or removing attributes from messages
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. The processor is instantiated and configured
//! 2. The processor receives and processes both data messages and control messages
//! 3. For each message, the processor can transform it, filter it, or split it into multiple messages
//! 4. The processor can maintain state between processing calls if needed
//! 5. The processor responds to control messages such as Config, TimerTick, or Shutdown
//! 6. The processor shuts down when it receives a `Shutdown` control message or encounters a fatal error
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! This implementation is designed for use in both single-threaded and multi-threaded environments.
//! The `Processor` trait requires the `Send` bound, enabling the use of thread-safe types.
//!
//! # Scalability
//!
//! To ensure scalability, the pipeline engine will start multiple instances of the same pipeline
//! in parallel on different cores, each with its own processor instance.

    /// Processes a message and optionally produces effects, such as generating new pdata messages.
    ///
    /// This method is called by the pipeline engine for each message that arrives at the processor.
    /// Unlike receivers, processors have known inputs (messages from previous stages), so the pipeline
    /// engine can control when to call this method and when the processor executes.
    ///
    /// This approach allows for greater flexibility and optimization, giving the pipeline engine
    /// the ability to decide whether to spawn one task per processor or one task for a group of processors.
    /// The method signature uses `&mut self` rather than `Box<Self>` because the engine only wants to
    /// temporarily allow mutation of the processor instance, not transfer ownership.
    ///
    /// The processor can:
    /// - Transform the message and return a new message
    /// - Filter the message by returning None
    /// - Split the message into multiple messages by returning a vector
    /// - Handle control messages (e.g., Config, TimerTick, Shutdown)
    ///
    /// # Parameters
    ///
    /// - `msg`: The message to process, which can be either a data message or a control message
    /// - `effect_handler`: A handler to perform side effects such as sending messages to the next node.
    ///    This can be either Send or !Send depending on the processor's Mode type.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// - `Ok(())`: The processor successfully processed the message
    /// - `Err(Error)`: The processor encountered an error and could not process the message
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
