//! Set of traits and structures used to implement receivers.
//!
//! A receiver is an ingress node that feeds a pipeline with data from external sources while
//! performing the necessary conversions to produce messages in an OTEL compatible format (OTLP or
//! OTAP).
//!
//! A receiver can operate in various ways, including:
//!
//! 1. Listening on a socket to receive push-based telemetry data,
//! 2. Being notified of changes in a local directory (e.g. log file monitoring),
//! 3. Actively scraping an endpoint to retrieve the latest metrics from a system,
//! 4. Or using any other method to receive or extract telemetry data from external sources.

/// A trait for ingress receivers.
///
/// Receivers are responsible for accepting data from external sources and converting
/// it into messages that can be processed by the pipeline.
///
/// # Lifecycle
///
/// 1. The receiver is instantiated and configured
/// 2. The `start` method is called, which begins the receiver's operation
/// 3. The receiver processes both internal control messages and external data
/// 4. The receiver shuts down when it receives a `Shutdown` control message or encounters a fatal error
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// Note that this trait uses `#[async_trait(?Send)]`, meaning implementations
/// are not required to be thread-safe. To ensure scalability, the pipeline engine will start
/// multiple instances of the same pipeline in parallel, each with its own receiver instance.

    /// The pipeline engine will call this function to start the receiver in a separate task.
    /// Receivers are assigned their own dedicated task at pipeline initialization because their
    /// primary function involves interacting with the external world, and the pipeline has no
    /// prior knowledge of when these interactions will occur.
    ///
    /// The `Box<Self>` signature indicates that when this method is called, the receiver takes
    /// exclusive ownership of its instance. This approach is necessary because a receiver cannot
    /// yield control back to the pipeline engine - it must independently manage its inputs and
    /// processing timing. The only way the pipeline engine can interact with the receiver after
    /// starting it is through the control message channel.

    /// use the EffectHandler to send messages to the next node(s) in the pipeline.
