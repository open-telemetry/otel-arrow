# Benchmarks

**Status:** *Work in Progress*

## Benches

This workspace includes **Criterion-based micro-benchmarks** for the
`otap-dataflow` crates. These benchmarks help evaluate and track the
performance of individual components and cross-cutting functionality over time.

### Bench Directory Structure

All benchmarks are defined under the `benchmarks/benches/` directory.
The organization mirrors the structure of the crates in `crates/`:

- **Crate-specific benchmarks**:
  Located in subdirectories named after the crate, e.g.,
  `benchmarks/benches/config/` for `crates/config`.

- **Cross-crate or e2e benchmarks**:
  General-purpose or integration-style benchmarks that span multiple
  crates may be placed in directories such as `benchmarks/benches/e2e/`.

> Note: crate specific tests in the root benchmarks directory (rather
> than in the specific crate) allows for single-command invocations
> which include extra criterion flags (e.g. --no-plot --output-format bencher).
> If, moving these out at some point - additional scripting may be required.

### Adding New Benchmarks

To add a benchmark for a new crate:

#### 1. Add the crate as a dependency in `benchmarks/Cargo.toml`

Example:

```toml
[dependencies]
otap-df-config = { path = "../crates/config" }
```

#### 2. Add a [[bench]] entry for the benchmark target

This declares the benchmark file and disables the default test harness
(as required by Criterion):

```toml
[[bench]]
name = "config"
harness = false
```

This will expect a file at: `benchmarks/benches/config/main.rs`

#### 3. Create the benchmark file

Use Criterion's macro-based structure. Example:

```rust
use criterion::{criterion_group, criterion_main, Criterion};
use otap_df_config::some_function;

fn bench_some_function(c: &mut Criterion) {
    c.bench_function("some_function", |b| b.iter(|| some_function()));
}

criterion_group!(benches, bench_some_function);
criterion_main!(benches);
```

### Running Benchmarks

From the workspace root:

```bash
cargo bench -p benchmarks
```
