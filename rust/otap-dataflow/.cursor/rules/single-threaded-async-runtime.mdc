# Design Principles

- Target a single-threaded async runtime
- Declare async traits as `?Send`, providing `!Send` implementations and futures whenever practical
- Avoid synchronization primitives as much as possible
- Optimize for performance
- Avoid unbounded channels and data structures
- Minimize dependencies
