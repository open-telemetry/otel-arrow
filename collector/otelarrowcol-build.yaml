# This file describes a sample OpenTelemetry Collector build
# containing the primary OpenTelemetry Protocol with Apache Arrow
# components and a few generally useful components from the
# OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib repository that have proven useful.
#
# The full list of components is detailed below.  Many of these
# components are optional and meant to assist with experimentation
# and validation of the primary components.
#
# This configuration file be used as a starting point for building a
# custom gateway collector for deploying OpenTelemetry Protocol with
# Apache Arrow in production.  See the instructions in BUILDING.md.
