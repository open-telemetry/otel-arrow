# This file describes a sample OpenTelemetry Collector build
# containing the primary OpenTelemetry Protocol with Apache Arrow
# components and a few generally useful components from the
# OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib repository that have proven useful.
#
# The full list of components is detailed below.  Many of these
# components are optional and meant to assist with experimentation
# and validation of the primary components.
#
# This configuration file be used as a starting point for building a
# custom gateway collector for deploying OpenTelemetry Protocol with
# Apache Arrow in production.  See the instructions in BUILDING.md.

  module: github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/collector/cmd/otelarrowcol
  name: otelarrowcol
  description: OpenTelemetry Protocol with Apache Arrow development collector, for testing and evaluation

  # Note: this version number is replaced to match the current release using `sed`
  # during the release process, see ../../../RELEASING.md.
  version: 0.11.0

  # Note: This should match the version of the core and contrib
  # collector components used below (e.g., the debugexporter and
  # otlphttpexporter versions below).
  otelcol_version: 0.90.1

  # Project-internal use: Directory path required for the `make
  # genotelarrowcol`, which the Dockerfile also recognizes.
  #
  # Users: This can be customized for integration into your CI/CD system.
