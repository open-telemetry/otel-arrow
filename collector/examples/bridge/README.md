# Example OpenTelemetry Protocol with Apache Arrow bridge

To run the exporting side of the bridge,

```
$COLLECTOR --config edge-collector.yaml
```

To run the receiving side of the bridge,

```
$COLLECTOR --config saas-collector.yaml
```

You may use the [`generator`](../generator/README.md) example to
produce data and the [`printer`](../printer/README.md) to display data
received on the other end.

Prometheus metrics describing the OpenTelemetry Protocol with Apache
Arrow components are available at `127.0.0.1:8888` and `127.0.0.1:8889`.
