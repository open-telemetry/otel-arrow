# Building the components in this repository

There are several options for building the components in this
repository.  This is a Golang code base, so users familiar with
building and installing Golang will find this easy to do using Golang
tools.  Docker build instructions are also provided.

The recommended practice for building the OpenTelemetry Collector uses
a [`builder` tool][BUILDER].  The builder synthesizes a Golang
`go.mod` file and main package with a specific set of components.  If
you are trying to modify and build code in this repository, see
[CONTRIBUTING.md][], otherwise the instructions here
will help you simply build the code in order to try it out.

## Building a collector from local sources using an installed Golang toolchain

The `./cmd/otelarrowcol` directory contains a pre-generated collector
build with a set of demonstration components detailed in
[`./cmd/otelarrowcol/build-config.yaml`][BUILDCONFIG].

Users who have a recent Golang toolchain installed and wish to build a
collector for the host operating system can simply run `make
otelarrowcol` at the top level of this repository.  The executable is
placed in `./bin/otelarrowcol`.  You will be able to run the
[examples][EXAMPLES] using the resulting artifact.

```
make otelarrowcol
./bin/otelarrowcol_darwin_arm64 --config collector/examples/bridge/saas-collector.yaml
```

You can also build and run directly from the directory containing the
main file, e.g.,

```
go run ./collector/cmd/otelarrowcol --config collector/examples/bridge/edge-collector.yaml
```

Note that the `go.work` file in the top-level of this repository
enables running `otelarrowcol` from the top-level directory.

## Installing a collector using remote sources with an installed Golang toolchain

The `go install` command can build and install a collector by
downloading the sources to the latest release itself.

```
go install github.com/open-telemetry/otel-arrow/collector/cmd/otelarrowcol
```

This installs `otelarrowcol`, which can be run with, e.g.,

```
otelarrowcol --config <path-to-config.yaml>
```

## Building a collector from local sources using Docker

Some vendors and platform providers offer pre-built OpenTelemetry
collector "distros" including compoments they recommend for use.  When
your vendor or platform provider adds support for OpenTelemetry
Protocol with Apache Arrow, you may wish to use the artifacts provided
by them.

The top-level `Dockerfile` in this repository demonstrates how to
build `otelarrowcol` as a container image, and it can easily be
modified for integration into a custom build and release pipeline.

With Docker installed, simply run:

```
make docker-otelarrowcol
```

You will now be able to run the [examples][EXAMPLES] using the
resulting `otelarrowcol` image.
